# 2. FROM THE PRAIRIE TO THE BATTLEFIELD

If there is a decision to be made,

and an enemy to be singled out,

it\'s the techno-libertarian religion of the \"free\".[^05chapter02_1]

Despite a general agreement among scholars about the historical
experiences that marked the birth and development of the digital
communitarian paradigm, in the last sections of the previous chapter, I
suggested broadening the scope of experiences that contributed to
digital communitarianism. As a matter of fact, in late 2000s the
understanding of digital community has spread to so many domains that
one might wonder whether it retains some semantic value, whether it is
still possible to distinguish a particular essence behind the label
'online community'.

In chapter 3 we shall engage with a few authors who tried to answer this
question. Before that, however, in order to understand some aspects of
this dilution, we need first to recognize how the internet anarchic
prairie has turned into a battlefield, a conflictual field not very
different from the brick-and-mortar world. My argument is that over the
recent years libertarian cyberculture that nurtured the virtual
communitarian utopia came to a crossroads. Since early 2000s, many of
the beliefs that the digital communitarians inherited from cyberculture
have either revealed their inconsistency or had to face empirical
counter-evidence. This chapter confutes, in particular, three myths: the
coalition between creative and economic actors, the uncontrollability of
the internet, and its freedom from commercial dynamics.

## 2.1 The Dotcom Burst and the Crisis of the Creatives-Internet Entrepreneurs Coalition

The first communitarian myth that had to face the new climax of early
2000s was the one associated with the emergence of an autonomous
creative class. It was believed that their lifestyle and economic weight
could influence global markets towards informal and more equal
organization of labour and production. Politically too, they would
perhaps push towards post-democratic forms of direct participation.

Let's follow the genesis of this myth. As we have seen in the previous
chapter, in mid 1990s' net culture, leftists' positions tended to
coexist and share resources with neo-liberalist agendas. This
coexistence is reflected by the literature on 'immaterial work'.[^05chapter02_2]
Over the years, actors who led the digital revolution have been called
alternatively 'creative class', 'hacker class', 'creative workers',
'cognitarians'.[^05chapter02_3] While these labels share some common traits as to
the new relevance of knowledge-related assets, they quite differ as far
as their rationales are concerned.

According to Richard Florida, the creative class is an emerging subject
whose power lies in its capacity to produce knowledge.[^05chapter02_4] His argument
is based on two assumptions: that techno-economic innovation is more and
more fed by artistic creativity, and that knowledge-based capitalism is
pushed to extend its scope in order to grasp the creative potential of
those social actors who were at the margins of the old system of
production. According to this argument, the new class does not own nor
control material means of production, but rather bases its economic
power on the immaterial capital of the mind. Furthermore, in Florida's
argument internet companies' executives are themselves part of the
creative class. As a consequence, the conflict between capital and
labour is reduced to the tensions between creativity and organization,
informality and old hierarchies.

Differently, Wark's hacker class includes creative workers that have
been expropriated of their own immaterial means of production.[^05chapter02_5]
According to this perspective, internet companies, the cultural
industry, and telcos executives belong to a distinct 'vector class'
which founds its economic power on a system that struggles to extend
intellectual property rights to all forms of immaterial production. By
extending the intellectual property regime with help from the juridical
apparatus, the vector class reduces immaterial commons into goods, thus
producing that principle of scarcity which is necessary to the
proliferation of the capitalistic market. By conceiving of the hacker
class as a by-product of this process, Wark's argument proposed an (at
that time) original elaboration of the Marxist opposition between
capital and labour.

Florida's and Wark's divergent perspectives as to the ownership of
immaterial means of production and intellectual property reflect the
coexistence of different souls in the internet cultures of mid and late
1990s.[^05chapter02_6] This coexistence was made feasible first of all by a cultural
compatibility. In mid 1990s, the internet perfectly fitted the
libertarian anti-state and market-oriented agenda which was popular at
that time. Embodied by Newt Gingrich's 'Contract with America', that
agenda was meant to give massive power to financial institutions.[^05chapter02_7]
Furthermore, sections 1.1. and 1.2 above have suggested ever more
profound cultural similarities. As we have seen, libertarianism had
fostered forms of organization of labour that were perfectly suited to
neoliberalism. Creative workers and internet entrepreneurs shared a
decentralized organizational paradigm and self-entrepreneurship ethics
that they both had inherited from cybernetics and excellence-oriented
peer communities. They also shared Wiener's suspicion towards big powers
as opposed to grassroots organizations: as Castells has recalled, in the
New Economy system of values, money became a symbol of independence from
that traditional corporate world from which both digital wizards and
entrepreneurs felt the greatest distance.[^05chapter02_8]

Economic interests sustained the coexistence between creatives and
internet capitals, as well. The non-profit internet communitarian
culture has rarely developed economic models for its sustainability. Or
better, its economic models have been mainly based on the concept of
'heterarchy'. Introduced by David Stark in order to explain the
behaviour of firms in post-Soviet Eastern Europe, the concept of
'heterarchy' is recovered by Turner and associated with the methods of
evaluating value on the WELL:

> within a heterarchy one encounters multiple, and at times competing,
> value systems, principles of organization, and mechanisms for
> performance appraisal. "Heterarchies create wealth by inviting more
> than one way of evaluating worth". \[...\] On the WELL, users'
> abilities to characterize their postings as having value in both the
> social and the economic registers depended on both the computer
> technology of the WELL and the cultural legacy of the New Communalist
> movement.[^05chapter02_9] [^05chapter02_10]

In substance, while voluntarily contributing to the creation of common
knowledge, WELLites invested in their reputation capital that ultimately
led to a number of working opportunities.

Turner limits the application of the heterarchy concept to the WELL.
However, it is not difficult to recognise a similar mechanism at work
among developers and creatives participating in 1990s' digital
communities. It is well-known that reputation capital and knowledge that
had been acquired through communitarian activities started being made
productive elsewhere in the new euphoric high-tech industry by digital
creatives.

To indicate an emergent social class whose roots lay at the convergence
of cultural values and economic interests between internet
entrepreneurs, on one side, and the social actors that led the digital
revolution, on the other, Formenti introduced the concept of 'Fifth
State'.[^05chapter02_11] In his work following the Dotcom burst and 9/11, Formenti
put forward a hypothesis overtly in counter-tendency with those
developments. He suggested that -- although knowledge workers were
undergoing a severe loss of contractual power because of the burst --
there still existed some chances to reconstitute the coalition between
creatives and entrepreneurial power. If that hypothesis had turned out
right -- Formenti argued -- there would have been a good chance for
western democracies to evolve towards post-democratic political systems
in which forms of representational democracy could mingle with forms of
direct participation.

Nevertheless, by 2008 Formenti had to admit that his hypothesis would
have never come true.[^05chapter02_12] With the collapse of 500 dotcoms, half
million jobs lost in the high-tech industry, and three trillions dollars
ending up in smoke at NASDAQ, the Dotcom burst not only had venture
capitals take to their heels, but had also marked the end of dreams for
bottom-up alliances. The Dotcom burst ratified the failure of the
coalition between the rebels of the net and emerging internet
entrepreneurs. If later on the net economy did recover from the burst,
the coalition between knowledge workers and internet companies had sunk.

While the ideological alliance between techno-anarchism and neoliberism
broke into fragments in 2000, another alliance, based on completely
different presuppositions, was appearing on the horizon and became solid
with 9/11: the alliance between governments and those internet companies
that had survived the burst and had become giant corporations.

## 2.2 The Territorialization of the Net

We saw in section 1.1 that one of the pillars that the digital
communitarian culture inherited from cybernetics is the possibility to
keep the virtual and the brick-and-mortar domains separated. The idea of
a virtual network unassailable by old 'hard' powers emerged together
with efforts to build a network architecture that could survive nuclear
attacks.[^05chapter02_13] It is a leading principle not only of J.P. Barlow's
Declaration of Independence, of Electronic Frontier Foundation's
campaign against the Communications Decency Act and of Rheingold's
reports from the WELL, it also characterizes Indymedia's efforts to
create self-organized digital infrastructures. That is, the separation
of virtual and real domains is a foundational principle not only of
digital communities directly informed by the U.S. libertarian paradigm,
but also of those inspired by more heterogeneous sources.

This separation is based on the notion of a completely
de-territorialized internet, an intrinsically borderless network that
can escape efforts to reduce it to nation-state boundaries, sovereignty
and laws. However, pressures for political control and surveillance
introduced after 9/11 and the so called 'War on Terror' have put this
assumption under considerable strain.[^05chapter02_14]

Already in 1999 Lawrence Lessig warned against the architectures of
regulation exercised by technologies of 'smooth' commerce, backed by the
rule of law.[^05chapter02_15] More recently, Stanford's researchers Goldsmith and Wu
have depicted a more and more controlled and territorialized internet.
They argue that since mid-1990s the internet has been transformed 'from
a technology that resists territorial law to one that facilitates its
enforcement'.[^05chapter02_16] Instead of imposing its cosmopolitan culture on local
milieus, the global net seems to be adapting to local conditions and
norms. According to the authors, the 'Balkanization of the Net' is made
possible by close teamwork between governments and global internet
companies, which formally foster the cult of networking freedom. Three
factors are pushing this course.

First, users themselves ask for culture-targeted internet browsing:
'geographical borders first emerged on the internet not as a result of
fiats by national governments, but rather organically, from below,
because internet users around the globe demanded different internet
experiences that corresponded to geography'.[^05chapter02_17] The primary demand
concerns language. While in late 1990s 80% of internet contents were in
English,[^05chapter02_18] by 2002 English web pages were only 50% of the total
amount.[^05chapter02_19] On 30th June 2008, the percentage of non-English native
internet users worldwide was 70,6%.[^05chapter02_20] While the amount of
English-speaking internet users grew 203.5% from 2000 to 2008, in the
same period the amount of Chinese-speaking internet users grew 755.1%,
Spanish-speaking internet users grew 405.3%, Portuguese-speaking
internet users grew 668% and Arabic-speaking internet users grew
2.063,7%. With these demand rates for non-English information, content
providers are more and more pushed to offer services that meet local
linguistic and cultural needs.

The second factor follows as a consequence. The need to meet local needs
can now rely upon geo-identification technologies that automatically
localize the user and provide targeted information or block 'forbidden'
contents. While geo-ID technologies have at first been developed in
order to filter information for commercial purposes, the alliance
between internet companies and governments that followed the War on
Terror has in fact shown new surveillance-oriented applications.

Goldsmith and Wu dedicate a whole chapter to the Chinese case. Here, the
'Great Electronic Wall' could not have been built without Cisco's
gateways and Google's filtering systems. These same internet
corporations that elsewhere are champions of the 'free flows of
information' ideology, in China subscribed a binding self-discipline
pact according to which they cannot 'produce or disseminate harmful
texts or news likely to jeopardize national security and social
stability, violate laws and regulations, or spread false news,
superstitions and obscenities'.[^05chapter02_21]

Chinese internet writers' arrests demonstrate how virtual life can have
dire consequences on physical life once geo-ID technologies allow to
associate a physical address to an IP address. Furthermore, they reveal
that there is no internet architecture which is 'naturally'
uncontrollable:

> \[the Chinese Government\] is trying to create an Internet that is
> free enough to support and maintain the fastest growing economy, and
> yet closed enough to tamp down political threats to its monopoly on
> power. \[...\] Only time will tell whether the China strategy will
> work, or whether the sheer volume of information will erode the
> government's influence and render the Internet in China open and free.
> But so far, China is showing the opposite: that the Internet enjoyed
> in the West is a choice -- not fate, not destiny, and not natural
> law.[^05chapter02_22]

The third factor for the Balkanization of the Net concerns western
control policies backed by ID technologies. Democratically elected
governments worldwide have found ways to impose their laws on internet
as a transnational territory as well. Even if a nation-state can exert
coercive power only within its borders, Goldsmith and Wu note that
global internet companies usually 'hit the ground' in local branches
that can be subjected to government pressures. Dow Jones, Yahoo, eBay,
Pay Pal, Google, and MasterCard are examples of large firms present in
many nations that had to comply with national laws of countries where
they do business.

As their book title suggests,[^05chapter02_23] once the internet is subjected to
nation-state sovereignty, the core issue shifts from techno-pundits'
concerns about internet controllability to legitimizing the sources of
law. As Italian former head of the Privacy Authority, Rodotà pointed
out, lack of rules would hand the internet over to the same big powers
against which it was originally born.[^05chapter02_24] According to Rodotà, freeing
the internet from juridical control established by democratically
elected parliaments means turning it into a space where the only rules
in force are those made by the most powerful actors, according to their
specific needs.[^05chapter02_25] As a consequence of a similar privatization of
regulatory functions, law would lose its *super-partes* nature.[^05chapter02_26]

In summary, at the end of 2000s, techno-political developments have
shrunk the gap between virtual and physical domains. As a matter of
fact, cyberculture's libertarian credo of an intrinsically ungovernable
internet has turned out to be an illusion. In spite of declarations of
independence, today geography matters more than ever.

## 2.3 Web 2.0, the Renaissance of Community on the Net and the Quest for Value Creation

The third libertarian belief that has faced scepticism over the last
years postulates that information sharing empowers individuals and
communities vis-a-vis governmental and commercial powers. As we saw in
chapter 1, the ethics of sharing is a cornerstone of internet
architecture. While this is true of internet protocols and standards,
however, it is less ascertained for data produced by net surfers, the so
called 'user-generated contents' (UGC). The assumption that online
interactions produce diffuse wealth, stronger political participation,
reduction of inequalities, empowerment of disadvantaged sectors of
population needs to be demonstrated.

This assumption gained momentum soon after the Dotcom burst, when
internet pundits and cyberculturalists denied the economic models they
had followed over the previous years, and recalled the inherently open
and sharing-oriented nature of the internet. In the words of Kevin
Kelly,

> so much money flew around dot-coms, that it hid the main event on the
> Web, which is the exchange of gifts. While the most popular 50
> websites are crassly commercial, most of the 3 billion web pages in
> the world are not. Only thirty percent of the pages of the Web are
> built by companies and corporations like pets.com. The rest is built
> on love, such as care4pets.com or responsiblepetcare.org. The answer
> to the mystery of why people would make 3 billion web pages in 2,000
> days is simple: sharing.[^05chapter02_27]

These words might constitute the first implicit reference to so called
'Web 2.0', that is, web platforms where information is supplied by users
themselves.[^05chapter02_28]

Between 2004 and 2005, 'online community' had turned into a much
inflated concept, and the opportunity was appropriate to replace it with
terms like 'social networks', 'mobs', 'swarms'.[^05chapter02_29] Simultaneously, the
recovered ethics of sharing contributed to the success of UGC-driven
web, a new business model expected to better fit the inherent openness
of the medium. According to Tim O'Reilly -- who introduced the
successful expression -- 'Web 2.0' constituted an effort to devise a
business model that respected the sharing-oriented nature of internet,
after the dotcom's failure demonstrated the inadequacy of old
pay-per-view business models. Indeed, Web 2.0 introduced new business
models that rely on online sociability as a fundamental source of value:

> Web 2.0 is the business revolution in the computer industry caused by
> the move to the internet as platform, and an attempt to understand the
> rules for success on that new platform. Chief among those rules is
> this: Build applications that harness network effects to get better
> the more people use them. (This is what I\'ve elsewhere called
> \"harnessing collective intelligence.\") Eric Schmidt has an even
> briefer formulation of this rule: \"Don\'t fight the internet.\"
> That\'s actually a wonderful way to think about it. Think deeply about
> the way the internet works, and build systems and applications that
> use it more richly, freed from the constraints of PC-era thinking, and
> you\'re well on your way. Ironically, Tim Berners-Lee\'s original Web
> 1.0 is one of the most \"Web 2.0\" systems out there \-- it completely
> harnesses the power of user contribution, collective intelligence, and
> network effects. It was Web 1.5, the dotcom bubble, in which people
> tried to make the Web into something else, that fought the internet,
> and lost.[^05chapter02_30]

This long quotation is useful to recall a key aspect often forgotten by
the UGC hype. Social network services were first and foremost a response
to the need to produce value on internet in new ways. This historical
evidence is usually underestimated in accounts dealing with Web 2.0
platforms. The December 2006 *Time* cover, for example, is a compendium
of much Web 2.0 rhetoric on renewed democracy, solidarity, and
grassroots cooperation. *Time*'s December 2006 cover story nominated the
crowds contributing UGC as 'Person of the Year':

> we\'re looking at an explosion of productivity and innovation, and
> it\'s just getting started, as millions of minds that would otherwise
> have drowned in obscurity get backhauled into the global intellectual
> economy. Who are these people? Seriously, who actually sits down after
> a long day at work and says, I\'m not going to watch *Lost* tonight.
> I\'m going to turn on my computer and make a movie starring my pet
> iguana? \[...\] The answer is, you do. And for seizing the reins of
> the global media, for founding and framing the new digital democracy,
> for working for nothing and beating the pros at their own game,
> TIME\'s Person of the Year for 2006 is you. [^05chapter02_31]

One might wonder about the rationale according to which shooting an
iguana-starring movie is related to founding the new digital democracy.
Similarly the assumption, that including millions of minds into the
global intellectual economy would cause an explosion of innovation and
seize the reins of global media, is all but tested. As some authors have
argued, the blogosphere can actually be very conservative, and prefer to
promote rather than compete against mainstream media.[^05chapter02_32]

*Time*'s article recovers cyberculture's duality between institutions
and individuals, top-down power and bottom-up communities:[^05chapter02_33]

> look at 2006 through a different lens and you\'ll see another story,
> one that isn\'t about conflict or great men. It\'s a story about
> community and collaboration on a scale never seen before. It\'s about
> the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the million-channel
> people\'s network YouTube and the online metropolis MySpace. It\'s
> about the many wresting power from the few and helping one another for
> nothing and how that will not only change the world, but also change
> the way the world changes.[^05chapter02_34]

Despite the high-sounding rhetoric, the article's theory of action is
explicit: Web 2.0 deals with small contributions that -- when assembled
together on a web platform -- gain a higher influence than professional
contents, and thus 'wrest power from the few' and give it back to the
many.

It is noticeable that this theory of action does not mention *which*
power to do *what*, nor what is supposed to keep the community together.
It does not show *in which direction* the world is changing its way of
changing, nor *who* will benefit from these changes. In other words, the
article replaces technological determinism with sociological
determinism, but refrains from questioning the cause-and-effect
explanatory model underpinning the alleged correlation between
collaboration and empowerment. Questions about *why* strangers
collaborate and how collaboration is supposed to lead to empowerment
remain unanswered.

Counter-evidence to this ideological theory of action comes from
political studies and political economy. First and unexpectedly, Web 2.0
platforms (said to empower individuals by providing tools for
self-expression and collaboration) are scarcely used by political
movements (supposed to be the champions of free speech and grassroots
organization). Indeed, empirical research has shown that political
movements are very reluctant to adopt multi-interactive services on
their websites.[^05chapter02_35]

For example, 'Searching the Net: An Analysis of the Democratic Use of
internet by 266 Social Movement Organizations' analysed the main website
features of 266 Global Justice Movement organizations in Italy, France,
Germany, Great Britain, Spain, and Switzerland, as well as at the
transnational level. Results revealed that internet is used to satisfy
five functions: diffusion of alternative information, identity-building,
debate and discussion, improving the transparency and accountability of
the organization, online, and offline mobilization. Despite efforts to
foster participation and empowerment constitute a large amount of
movements' online activities, the research showed that multi-interactive
tools other than forums and mailing lists are rarely implemented. Only
10% of social movement's websites use UGC technologies.[^05chapter02_36]

As the *Networked Politics* think tank has highlighted, social movements
make limited use of Web 2.0 technology. For example, while Wikipedia
started using wiki software in 2001, it was only in 2004 that the first
wiki platform was used in social forums. Furthermore, Indymedia -- which
introduced open-publishing platforms in political action[^05chapter02_37] -- is now
losing popularity, and recent initiatives aimed to build interactive
websites to organize social forums have had very limited diffusion.[^05chapter02_38]
As a matter of fact, these pieces of evidences call into question the
capability of Web 2.0 tools to foster bottom-up political participation
and empowerment.

Second, as Formenti has pointed out, the notion of empowerment
underpinning the Web 2.0 hype makes it difficult to distinguish between
democratic engagement, cyber-ideology, 'cyber-soviet'[^05chapter02_39], and
'cyber-pop'. Formenti provocatively wonders whether empowerment
coincides with the possibility to publish a post among million others,
or whether it even coincides with an alleged wisdom of the crowds. While
libertarian techno-enthusiasts claim their absolute confidence in the
capacity of Web 2.0 platforms to select the best contributions out of
millions, according to Formenti the definition of 'best' is never
'natural' nor objective, but is embodied in code. Google's Page Rank,
for instance, does not measure the quality and reliability of the
information contained in the pages indexed, but rather reflect a sort of
'popularity index'.[^05chapter02_40] [^05chapter02_41]

Furthermore, Formenti points out that empowerment does not relate to the
use of ICT for entertainment purposes, like for most Web 2.0
applications, but rather to the possibility of exploiting internet's
potential for life-long learning, work, cognitive enrichment, and
democratic participation.[^05chapter02_42] The author proposes the notion of
'cultural divide' to indicate the distinction between enthusiast
consumers of information technology that show low overall cultural
consumption rates (*technofans*), and those who combine technological
interest with other forms of cultural consumption (*eclectics*). While
the latter users retain the cultural skills that allow them to bend ICT
to their needs, technofans are more likely to enthusiastically adopt ICT
without developing the ability to harness its potential for personal
enrichment. According to Formenti, this cultural divide can easily be
transformed into a new class divide.[^05chapter02_43]

Third, the most elaborate counter-argument to Web 2.0's claims to
empower individuals and communities come from the labour economy. While
the openness of the digital architecture -- of code, protocols,
practices, and standards -- is a *condicio sine qua non* for the same
existence of the internet, the question of how a digital commons-driven
economy should distribute resources and wealth is still matter of
dispute. As a matter of fact, not only do online relationships
constitute a highly-targeted audience for profits based on adverts and
data mining, they also act as content producers in a newly New Economy
founded on the 'cult of the amateur'. Still, only very rarely do forms
of value distribution correspond to the voluntary supply of UGC.

Formenti numbers seven cases of Web 2.0 business models which have
succeeded in 'harnessing the collective intelligence' of users by
deploying participatory technologies: from readers' book reviews to
commercial intermediaries like e-Bay which create value by providing the
technological infrastructure for trust; from free footage shot with
prosumer technologies to UGC as ways to monitor cultural trends; from
traditional advertising finding new stimuli in fans' posts to
talent-scout activities online, to the spontaneous activity of
collaborative categorization performed by millions of individuals
online. However, probably the most interesting example of a business
model based on UGC comes from &dollar; 15bn *Facebook.*[^05chapter02_44] [^05chapter02_45] This
popular social networking site in November 2007 had *Coca-Cola,
Blockbuster, Verizon, Sony Pictures, Condé Nast*, and seven other global
brands make large advertising investments on its platform. Furthermore,
it is fresh news that *Facebook* is launching a new generation of
commercials called 'engagement ads'.[^05chapter02_46] With engagement ads, users
will be asked to respond to ads popping up when they log in, by
evaluating a product. Their reply will then be shared with their
*Facebook* friends.

As Guardian's journalist Tom Hodgkinson has pointed out, the interest of
companies towards 59 millions potential advocates of their brand is
usually framed as 'sharing':

> \[the creators of the site\] simply sit back and watch as millions of
> Facebook addicts voluntarily upload their ID details, photographs and
> lists of their favourite consumer objects. Once in receipt of this
> vast database of human beings, Facebook then simply has to sell the
> information back to advertisers, or, as Zuckerberg puts it in a recent
> blog post, 'to try to help people share information with their friends
> about things they do on the Web'. \[...\] 'Share' is Facebook speak
> for 'advertise'. Sign up to Facebook and you become a free walking,
> talking advert for Blockbuster or Coke, extolling the virtues of these
> brands to your friends. We are seeing the commodification of human
> relationships, the extraction of capitalistic value from
> friendships.[^05chapter02_47] [^05chapter02_48]

Similar arguments focusing on the production of value from non-economic
activities touch upon an unresolved issue of the new New Economy.
Although UGC are sources of value in Web 2.0 business models, none of
the most popular Web 2.0 platforms provides for the remuneration of
amateur authors.[^05chapter02_49] According to Lovink, the 'ideology of the free' is
systematically avoiding the crucial issue of a distributed economy in
the so-called 'knowledge society'.[^05chapter02_50] While 'liberal communists'[^05chapter02_51]
evade questions about their own business models, they mention users,
developers, citizens that would need to be 'liberated', rather than
enabled to earn a living from their creativity:

> in order to open new social spaces for action, it is necessary to get
> rid of the religion of the free: 'social media' need to develop their
> own economy. Giving one's own contents for free should be a voluntary,
> generous act and not the only option available. Instead of celebrating
> the amateur, we should develop a culture of the Internet that help
> young amateurs to become professionals. And this cannot happen if we
> preach to them that the only choice they have is to make ends meet
> through a McJob during daytime, so that they can celebrate their
> "freedom" during the long night hours spent online. A redistribution
> of money, resources and power is necessary.[^05chapter02_52]

If amateurs encounter difficulties in becoming professionals, the other
way round is not easier. A further limit of the emerging sharing economy
is the loss of influence by cultural industry professionals, as they are
replaced by amateurs. While networked organizations outsource more and
more risks and responsibilities to freelance contributors, they shrink
R&D resources for professionals. The concern that the cult of the
amateur constitutes a threat to creative workers is shared by ICT
analyst Nicholas Carr, as well. Carr has questioned the effective
quality of Wikipedia's articles, while admitting that the search for
quality tends to be overwhelmed by the search for free contents:

> the Internet is changing the economics of creative work - or, to put
> it more broadly, the economics of culture - and it\'s doing it in a
> way that may well restrict rather than expand our choices. Wikipedia
> might be a pale shadow of the Britannica, but because it\'s created by
> amateurs rather than professionals, it\'s free. And free trumps
> quality all the time. So what happens to those poor saps who write
> encyclopedias for a living? They wither and die. The same thing
> happens when blogs and other free on-line content go up against
> old-fashioned newspapers and magazines. \[...\] Implicit in the
> ecstatic visions of Web 2.0 is the hegemony of the amateur. I for one
> can\'t imagine anything more frightening.[^05chapter02_53]

Yet authors' loss of contractual power is not only due to their
replacement by amateurs. Organizational changes in the creative industry
also have a role. In a different article about the theory of
disintermediation, Carr argues that in the UGC production and
distribution chain, the most profitable position is that of the
intermediary. Contrary to cyberlibertarian claims celebrating the
end-to-end pattern of communication enabled by the web, 'internet
continues to be a rich platform for intermediation strategies, and it\'s
the intermediaries who stand to skim up most of the profits to be made
from Web 2.0'.[^05chapter02_54]

Venture capitalist David Hornik has linked the renewed relevance of
intermediaries to the Long Tail paradigm.[^05chapter02_55] He argues that there are
essentially two types of technology (and actors, I would add) that
benefit economically from the Long Tail: aggregators and filterers.
While aggregators and filterers rely upon the increasing volume and
diversity of content to boost their value, 'that growth of content will
not have a material impact upon the value of any one piece of content
floating somewhere in the Tail'.[^05chapter02_56] That is, the value produced by
filtering and aggregating activities will all go to the benefit of
intermediaries, not of content producers.

If these anticipations are confirmed, they will not only shape the
crisis of 21st century separation between labour and non-economic
activities, but will also call into question the same foundations of the
internet libertarian culture. Readers probably remember that in 2001
Lawrence Lessig numbered the features upon which the openness of the
internet relies. Among these, Lessig saw the peer-to-peer architecture
as the crucial element in the design of commons. Peer-to-peer
architectures led Lessig to assert that the wisdom of the network lies
on individual clients, and not on the network itself. Now that Web 2.0
platforms aggregating and filtering contents have centralized the wisdom
of the network, one could wonder which new principles the openness of
the internet is expected to rely upon.

In summary, many see the appropriation of the communitarian,
techno-libertarian vernacular by internet corporate companies at the
origin of the paradox of an informal gift economy turned into a
hundred-million-dollars machine. While the 'ideology of the free' has
pushed millions of people to upload their contents on Web 2.0 platforms,
there is a endemic lack of business models that foster an impartial,
distributed, and decentralized internet economy. The point is not so
much to question Web 2.0 models that seek to make profits out of users'
contents. Late 1990s' bubble has brought with it a much more
disenchanted gaze than that shown by the prophets of digital harmony and
gift economy. Rather, the point is about understanding what remains of
the 'digital community' once communal ties based on solidarity and the
gift economy are invoked as the cornerstone of commercial activities
whose revenues are kept in the hands of few corporations. While the
benefits for aggregating and filtering internet companies are quantified
by analysts in terms of millions of dollars,[^05chapter02_57] the theory of action
according to which participating in Web 2.0 open-publishing should
foster community empowerment, produce diffuse wealth, and boost stronger
participation to political processes is not as self-evident.

According to emergent scholarship on social network sites (SNSs),
participation in services like *Friendster, Orkut* or *Facebook*
provides resources for identity-building and reputation management.
Donath and boyd have shown that SNSs allow users to negotiate
presentations of self, and have suggested that the 'public display of
connection' serves as an important identity signal that helps people
navigate the networked social world.[^05chapter02_58] Furthermore, Choi has found
that 85% of respondents to a Korean study 'listed the maintenance and
reinforcement of pre-existing social networks as their main motive for
Cyworld use'.[^05chapter02_59]

If we consider these studies, the question then becomes whether
sociability in itself can be considered as an empowering factor, or
whether it acts as a means to reach further resources at different
sites. On one hand, sociability per se might be a meagre outcome, if
paid for in that precious currency of privacy.[^05chapter02_60] On the other hand,
studies that identify the nature of further resources are still few, and
mainly based at production sites.[^05chapter02_61]

To conclude, the skeptical perspectives we have reviewed in this section
have the merit to focus the discussion on the means of production in a
domain that has for long celebrated dematerialization. They also
introduce a conflictual perspective into digital utopianism. Similar
approaches help to raise the question as to whether the supposed
empowerment of individuals and communities through Web 2.0 tools belongs
only to the immaterial domain, or does it also apply to living resources
and wealth. At the same time, I suggest that the recovery of a
materialist perspective should avoid reproducing the virtual vs. real
dichotomy inherited from libertarian cyberculture. Claiming that the
knowledge dimension works as 'parasite' of the material dimension of
living in extracting value from creative workers only shows the other
side of the cyberculturalist coin.[^05chapter02_62] Rather, I argue that we cannot
understand what digital communities have become if we do not jointly
take into account their semiotic and technical character. After all,
knowledge communities do not thrive in a *vacuum*, but rely on
infrastructural layers that shape possible forms of interaction.

Finally, in the light of the breakdown of some of the internet
libertarian culture's funding myths, this chapter has shown that the
advantages of online interaction for individuals and communities cannot
be simply postulated, but needs to be investigated by asking actors
themselves about their own theory of empowerment. This is what this book
will do in the second part. Before embarking on this task, though, we
need to first review two theories that try to answer the question about
what remains of online communities once the techno-libertarian belief in
an immaterial economy of the free has come to a crossroads.

Box 1 - The manifesto of the 'No Screw Tube' campaign numbering seven
good reasons not to upload videos on YouTube-like Web 2.0 platforms. The
campaign was promoted by Transmission.cc, a global network of citizen
journalists, video makers, artists, researchers, hackers, and web
producers who developed online video distribution tools for social
justice and media democracy



> ###Why NOT Just Use YouTube? 
> ###The ‘No Screw Tube’ campaign is beginning…
> 
> **1. Exploitation:**
> ScrewTube exploits your free videomaking to gain ad revenue.
> 
> **2. Surveillance:**
> Posting on YT risks surveillance and IP tracking, both by corporations and the state. For example in 2004 Yahoo collaborated with Chinese authorities to identify dissident blogger Shi Tao. He is now serving 10 years in jail. Many sites record your IP address, not just corporate projects.
>
> **3. Censorship:**
Posting on YT opens the door to censorship since they will do takedowns at State request or for copyright violations.
>
> **4. When Sharing isn't really sharing:**
Sites like YT only allow sharing with other members, or by embedding YT videos in your site or blog. There is no re-distribution via p2p networks, or availability of high-resolution downloads for screenings.
>
> **5. When Free isn't really free:**
Though free to use, the platform is closed – using YT technology entails using YT. With free software platforms, anyone can create their own video-sharing site.
>
> **6. When a community isn't really a community:**
YouTube was sold to Google for &dollar;1.65 billion in Google stock. If it can be bought and sold, is it really a community? Editorial and software control should be in the hands of the user community. Control of ScrewTube sites is organised by the profit motive.
>
> **7. Intellectual Property:**
Sites like ScrewTube place exploitative terms and conditions on your contributions, allowing them to re-sell and remix your work.
>
> Using existing ethical and pirate technologies, we can do much, much better…
Projects like VisiononTv, Ifiwatch.tv, Engagemedia.org (Australia) and numerous Indymedia video spin-offs, coordinated through Transmission, are linking up their databases to create decentralised search tools. This will greatly increase the profile and possibilities for social justice video online.
>
> Using open source tools these projects hope that once you start watching in this way you won't go back! Miro allows subscription to different channels of video content; some themed and some the pick of channel editors. You can even subscribe to YouTube channels and it sneakily downloads those videos for you.
>
> Independent Media is not stagnant, it's mutating. We'll start to see the fruits of this mutation soon… so stay tuned.

    'reflect' a coexistence that was first experienced in the 1990s.
    After all, as Lovink, *My First Recession,* recalled, the Dotcom
    hype used to travel at such a speed that there are few books that

[^05chapter02_26]: Even if we cannot account here for the juridical literature on

    be mentioned that Rodotà talks about the privatization of governance
    functions on the internet (*Lex Informatica*) in a way that very
    much resembles Saskia Sassen's concerns about the privatization of
    the regulatory functions in transnational politics and trade (*Lex
    Mercatoria*). See S. Sassen, *Territory, Authority, Rights: from
    medieval to global assemblages*, Princeton: Princeton University

    provides a definition of Web 2.0 as user-oriented 'Ajax' web-based

    'Ten Liberal Communist Commandments' published by French magazine
    *Technikart*. The term indicates an economic paradigm that sees
    copyright as an impediment to knowledge-based economic flows and
    fosters the creation of immaterial commons while recovering Adam
    Smith's theory of the invisible hand. See S. Zizek, (2006), 'Nobody

    the most complete version of this post-modern eschatology: he

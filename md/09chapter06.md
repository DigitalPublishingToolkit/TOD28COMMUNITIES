#6. MEDIATORS UPKEEPING COMMUNITIES

Up to now we have struggled to extract meaning from a vast and
variegated set of accounts. In order to deal with almost one thousand
applications, we have been forced to reduce complexity to a manageable
level by relying on co-occurrence patterns and relational analysis. In
so doing, we've found a set of elements associated with 'online
community' (chapter 4), demonstrated the appropriateness of not
selecting a type of grouping in advance, and singled out some meaningful
topics and narratives (chapter 5).

During these stages, we have always refrained from the temptation to add
some explanation to what we were just describing. Every time this
temptation came to our mind, we struck up loudly our *noli me
tangere*[^09chapter06_1] towards definitions, correlations, conceptual assumptions
and methodological protocols. If such a lonely and renouncing Franciscan
path was undertaken, it is because at the end of 2000s postulating a
definition for a fuzzy object of study called 'online community' would
have cast this research miles away from (second level) objectivity.
Nothing would have been easier than starting from presuppositions. On
the contrary, it was the incommensurable distance between much diverse
initiatives -- all defined as 'online communities' -- that suggested the
need to make a clean sweep and start on a much longer and laborious
journey. Tracing back communities is still the goal of this journey,
mapping the cartography of the different theories of action associated
with them is the means.

The narratives discussed in the last chapter however suggest the need to
investigate, in depth, the role of digital artefacts in upkeeping
communities. The analysis conducted until now is half of the story, the
half that had to reduce the complexity of the social when dealing with
vast data sets. The other half lies in the opposite movement of
addition, proliferation, and observation. At this point of the book, the
time has come to increase the sensitivity of our analysis, and to
privilege an articulated observation of a small number of applications,
so that the role of artefacts may emerge in more detail than when
addressing the whole data set.

This chapter attempts to deepen the investigation into different
theories of action that underpin the development of digital communities
through the role attributed to artefacts. It analyses the relationship
between societal outcomes and digital artefacts, as it was laid down by
communities' spokespersons.

To do so, following Haraway's suggestion to think about scientific and
technological practice as story-telling, I conduct narrative analyses of
a smaller number of case studies.[^09chapter06_2] By focusing on the artefacts
whereby groups are kept assembled, I describe the theories of action
underpinning the rationale of the projects which from 2004 to 2007 were
granted a *Golden Nica* (first prize) or an *Award of Distinction*
(second prize) at Ars Electronica.

Notably, in the following analyses I have borrowed Latour's list of
traces left behind by activities of group formation[^09chapter06_3] and the
distinction between mediator and intermediary, already introduced in
section 5.2.[^09chapter06_4] From semiotics, the analysis has borrowed the notion of
'competence', the distinction between actants and actors and the notions
of 'Addresser' and 'Addressee' (see Table 10 in Annex C)[^09chapter06_5]. In
particular, the patient work in search of mediators does not claim to be
complete, even if, differently from chapters 4 and 5, here reduction is
sacrificed to proliferation, comprehensiveness to articulation.[^09chapter06_6]

## 6.1 Tonga.Online. Or of Rivers, Dams, Antelope Horns and Digital music

An amazingly rich case of proliferation of mediations is provided by the
*Tonga.Online* application. This project won an Award of Distinction in
2004. It is an offspring of a cultural exchange program between Austrian
and Zimbabwean artists and NGOs which has been running for more than ten
years. But let the spokesperson talk by herself:

> In 2001/02 the Tonga.Online project has established the first
> community-based Internet and Computer Centre in one of the remotest
> areas of Zimbabwe. Encouraged by the response, the project is now
> striving to reach out to other villages and across the waters of the
> Zambezi River into Zambia. The Tonga community -- only fifty years ago
> forcibly divided by the advent of modern technology and the building
> of Kariba dam -- has taken up the chance to use the most advanced
> communication technology for rebuilding and improving links within the
> community and with the world abroad. A truly local area network of
> telecentres is in the extension stage. One could perceive the Tonga
> people as a digital community per se because of their music. Despite
> their harsh living conditions the Tonga people have always adhered to
> their cultural heritage and ways of communicating oral traditions that
> are generations old. Their unique Ngoma Buntibe Music is a kind of
> binary or digital music in its own sense since one musician is
> mastering one note only by contributing a short blow on an antelope
> horn to an incredible storm of sound and stamping movements. Robert
> Bilek (a journalist with ORF / Vienna) after an encounter in 2001:
> 'The music of the Tonga could be perceived as a system of binary
> individual decisions, sound or silence, 1 or 0, within the matrix of a
> creative group performance. Through this sound, through this seemingly
> wild and chaotic order, the community reassures itself of its
> coherence\... It appears that the Tonga people's understanding of
> digital technology has its roots in their musical tradition. What
> could prevent them from covering new grounds using computers?' There
> is a smart gadget which has proved to be very helpful in expanding the
> project beyond the centres. It is a mobile device called Alpha Smart,
> a kind of expanded keyboard run on batteries. Penny Yon and Theophorah
> Sianyuka are closely monitoring the establishment of two more
> telecentres in Sianzyundu and Siachilaba villages from May 2004
> onwards. They will use the Alpha Smarts (and a digital camera) to
> provide and collect messages and digital reflections on the effects of
> the project extension and send them frequently onto the website
> www.mulonga.net. These contributions will create a kind of social
> intervention sculpture by addressing stakeholders and the general
> public -- from Siachilaba pupils to the fishermen or smugglers on Lake
> Kariba, from basket weaving women to the Chief's messenger on his bike
> or the Cuban doctor at Binga Hospital. This exercise will be concluded
> with the festive opening of the Centres on 4th/5th September 2004
> (concurrent with Ars Electronica Festival) when Ngoma Buntibe
> musicians from Binga area and their counterparts from Zambia will
> complement the modern means of communication and celebrate the smart X
> tension of the Tonga.Online project in their own way.[^09chapter06_7]

This account wonderfully testifies the flamboyant life of artefacts.
From dams on the Zambezi River to 'modern technology', from the Ngoma
Buntibe Music to mobile devices, all these entities take part in some
way in the course of action whose goal is 'rebuilding and improving
links within the community and with the world abroad'. From this
perspective, the extension of the project across the waters of the
Zambezi River provides the figuration into which the goal -- the unity
of the Tonga people -- is embodied. Fifty years earlier, this unity was
dismantled by 'the advent of modern technology and the building of
Kariba dam': two actants in their own right which are endowed with
figurations borrowed from the ranks of modernity.

In this account, three of the four kinds of traces left behind by the
formation of groups are present. Apart from the spokesperson --
obviously the one that submitted the project for evaluation and wrote
the application -- a professional enters the network in order to make
possible the durable definition of the community. Austrian journalist
Robert Bilek's account is itself part of what makes the group exist,
since it provides the community with a theory of action (see below). As
to the third trace left behind, boundaries are created and rendered
durable by appealing to tradition and cultural heritage: 'despite the
harsh living conditions the Tonga people have always adhered to their
cultural heritage and ways of communicating oral traditions that are
generations old'. It is the cultural heritage and the ways of
communication that define the Tonga community as a stable entity, that
make it hold against the centrifugal force exerted by the harsh living
conditions and that ferry the community directly into the digital age.

Actually, the theory of action underpinning the project's vision of the
digital community is overtly expressed through the journalist's voice:
'it appears that the Tonga people's understanding of digital technology
has its roots in their musical tradition'. It is the traditional Ngoma
Buntibe Music that act as a powerful mediator and translates agency from
the 'short blow on an antelope horn' into a binary -- and therefore
digital -- sound. The Ngoma Buntibe Music is not only what keeps the
Tonga people united in spite of the diaspora started by modern
technologies, but also the actant that carries this assemblage into the
computer era.

Once the Tonga assemblage has shored on the quieter coasts of digital
post-modernity, other adjutants get to march side by side with the Ngoma
Buntibe Music to realize the goal of extending the project over
geographical boundaries. Notably, the mobile device Alpha Smart 'proved
to be very helpful in expanding the project beyond the centres'.[^09chapter06_8]
Here, information technology allows the project leaders to activate new
mediators: 'messages and digital reflections' that, in turn, create new
associations with geographically dispersed actants, stakeholders,[^09chapter06_9]
Siachilaba pupils, the fishermen or smugglers on Lake Kariba, basket
weaving women, the Chief's messenger on his bike, the Cuban doctor.

The *Tonga.Online -- smart X tension* project is an exemplary case where
mediators proliferate and the chain that translates agency stretches out
in many directions. Nonetheless, this is a peculiar case: it may happen
that the chain is arbitrarily short-cut before agency be fully unfolded,
as we are going to see in the next section.

## 6.2 ICT and Developing Countries: Empowerment as a Cause-and-effect Relationship

The case studies discussed in this section do not represent the totality
of the winning projects implemented in developing countries, but only
those whose goals deal with empowerment of disadvantaged populations
and/or consider belonging to the so called 'Global South' as a
distinguishing element. We have already taken into consideration
projects showing narratives of empowerment in chapters 4 and 5. Here, by
analysing four cases in depth, I show how similar projects tend to be
associated with short chains of action.

Differently from the *Tonga.Online* project, the *Akshaya* submission
characterizes itself for the low number of mediators involved in the
course of action. This project -- that won the Golden Nica in 2005 --
was developed in Kerala (India) to address the question of digital
divide. It was implemented by the Government of Kerala through Kerala
State IT Mission, the agency for implementing IT policies, and was run
by local entrepreneurs.

In the submission,[^09chapter06_10] four objectives and relative theories of action
are mentioned. The first goal ('Universal IT Access') aims at setting
and maintaining 4500 -- 6000 Akshaya e-centres. Here, only one mediator
is involved: entrepreneurs running the centres rely on e-literacy
courses to assure self-sustainability to each centre. Other
technological entities -- broadband wireless, computers, scanners,
printers, webcams, software, IP phones -- appear as mere intermediaries,
since their presence does not affect the outcome.

The second objective ('E-literacy') aims at familiarizing people with IT
and improving their computer skills. There exist also a meta-goal: to
'create a 100% literate state'. Here, the theory of action is
underpinned by an overtly causal relation: 'the process of providing the
skill sets shall lead to the creation of a long lasting relation between
the Akshaya centres and the families in the catchment, which on a macro
level will generate a state wide data warehouse and repository'
(*Akshaya* submission). In these words, it is not clear *through which
means* the process of providing skills will cause a stable relationship
whose ultimate outcome is a data repository. As we have seen, in the
social domain stability is a costly exception. Face-to-face, unequipped
interactions using only basic social skills pertain to a very limited
sphere, namely to baboons.[^09chapter06_11] Unequipped interactions alone cannot
bear the weight of maintaining stable relationships that need to be
ceaselessly negotiated. It is objects that allow long-standing
relationships. However, in the *Akshaya* account there are no traces of
the means whereby the long lasting relation between the centres and the
families are supposed to be maintained.

A similar lack of mediators characterizes also the third ('Creation of
Micro ICT Enterprises') and fourth ('Creation of ICT Service Delivery
Points') objectives. As to the creation of micro IT enterprises, the
theory of action is 'im-mediate': entrepreneurs emerged from the local
community are seen as lending their 'entrepreneurial spirit' to the
'total development' of community. Here again, no mediators intervene
either in the emergence of the entrepreneurs from the community, or in
the opposite translation of this spirit from entrepreneurs to
communities. Their 'skills and resources' just transport agency: they do
not affect the outcome in one direction rather than another, nor trigger
other mediators.

Summing up, in the *Akshaya* account there are some intermediaries and
only one mediator. Agency gets stopped after few passages and may not
rely on entities that translate the initial inputs. As a matter of fact,
apart from their role as birth places of the entrepreneurs, there are
few references to local communities and the relationship between
technology and social ties is explained in terms of cause-and-effect, as
one of 'empowerment' im-mediately proceeding from e-centres to families.

A less deterministic theory of action characterizes *Proyecto Cyberela
-- Radio Telecentros*, a Brazilian initiative that was granted an Award
of Distinction in 2006. As it is explained in the submission,[^09chapter06_12] this
project was started in 1990 by the NGO *Cemina* as an initiative aimed
at 'developing female communitarian leadership as an agent of social
transformation'. Since this early commitment, the (analogue) radio has
been conceived of as a strategic adjuvant, a media(tor) enabling women
to promote human rights and gender empowerment: 'the radio as a medium
was chosen for that purpose because it is the simplest and cheapest
means of communication, and it reaches 98% of the population, being that
women are the biggest listeners' (*Proyecto Cyberela -- Radio
Telecentros* submission, Author's translation). Over the years, female
radio-makers attending Cemina's classes gathered in the *Red de Mujeres
de Rádio (RMR)*: an assemblage born out of the desire to 'strengthen
their activities'.

However, with the advent of digital information technologies new
challenges arose and new mediators were needed. The new goal became to
include women into the new digital realm:

> the scenario imposed by the new information and communication
> technologies (ICT) presented a great challenge for Cemina: either
> women are part of that process or they would be once again excluded
> from the equal participation to society. Including women in the world
> of information technology and the Internet, while continuing to use
> the radio, became a priority for the institution.[^09chapter06_13]

On one hand, the change of the strategic goal from 'developing female
leadership' to 'including women in the computer and internet domain'
marks a major shift in the role of information technologies: from being
instruments, ICT are transformed into 'skills' and become the main goal
('prioridad') of the course of action. On the other hand, gender-focused
attention is transformed: from being the result of sensitization
policies it becomes an intermediary (in the form of 'contents') that can
attract women. Notably, if the (now digital) radio continues to act as a
mediator, it is because it renders gender-related contents available:
'www.radiofalamulher.com helped to intensify the strategy of attracting
women to that universe with the availability of radio content with a
focus on gender and human rights on the Internet' (*Proyecto Cyberela --
Radio Telecentros* submission, Author's translation). If the internet
radio 'helped' -- and is thus a mediator --, there is no further
specification about *how* contents attracted women to be included in the
digital realm. This arbitrary restraint of the course of action shows
that gender and human rights-focused contents act as mere
intermediaries. Table 11 summarizes this analysis, stressing the
changing role of communication artefacts.

<small>Table 11 - *Proyecto Cyberela -- Radio Telecentros*. Variations in the
role of radio, ICT and gender commitment following the advent of digital
media</small>

Ferrying the radio-makers assemblage into the digital age requires more
adjutants than before: the World Bank *Infodev* Program, the *Kellogg*
Foundation and UNESCO thus sustained the newly born *Red Cyberela* with
technical facilities (i.e., computers, audio editing software, high
bandwidth) and support (i.e., training, technical assistance). It is
interesting to note that in this submission a clear symmetry exists
between humans (i.e., World Bank, *Kellogg* Foundation, UNESCO) seen as
mediators and non-humans (i.e., technical facilities) seen as
intermediaries.

To fully catch the theory of action underpinning this project, there is
still a consideration to make. The project's great interest in the
digital domain lies on the principle that ICT are causing major
transformations in every field of human activity: 'the emergence of
information and communication technologies (ICT) has transformed social
relations, education, work, economy and even behavior'.[^09chapter06_14] (As a
consequence, access to ICT is seen as a pre-condition for development.
The submission justifies this consideration through statistical data
depicting women as deeply excluded from access to ICT, to the point that
the United Nations and 'all the indicators of human development' have
recognized women access to ICT as strategic. In other words, the gender
perspective is legitimized by appealing to statistical data. It is
statistics that provides the boundaries around which the group
'disempowered women' is made to exist.

Also the third project discussed in this section uses statistics as a
source for setting up group boundaries.[^09chapter06_15] *The World Starts With Me*
focuses on young Ugandans between 12 and 19. This project -- which won
the Golden Nica in 2004 -- provided a digital learning environment about
sexual and reproductive health education and AIDS prevention. Its goal
was double: to 'improve the sexual health of young people in East Africa
while providing \[computer\] skills relevant to the job market' (*The
World Starts With Me* submission). Here, too, entering the digital age
by acquiring computer skills is one of the objectives. Nonetheless,
differently from the previous project, in this case ICT skills are not
only a 'necessity to enter the job market', but also something that
'stimulates curiosity to learn more'. That is, computer skills are not
merely conceived of as the point of arrival, but as a competence that
triggers other actions.

The *World Starts With Me* program is rather complex and gathers a lot
of mediators, both human and non-human. There are five main groups
involved in the project:

> \- the WSWM development and program teams; Butterfly Works and WPF,
> Netherlands - The individual schools, teachers and students who use /
> run the program in Uganda co-ordinated by SchoolNet Uganda - The SRH
> partners for knowledge and counselling back up; WIDE and FPA, Uganda -
> The SRH partner for online counselling; Straight Talk, Uganda - The
> NairoBits project, who run the pilot in Nairobi, Kenya,[^09chapter06_16]

The Dutch NGO *Butterfly Works* developed the project with local
artists, health trainers and teachers supported by the *World Population
Foundation* (WPF), a Dutch foundation supporting programs about sexual
and reproductive health in developing countries. The *SchoolNet Uganda
network* linked and supported 52 schools and telecentres throughout
Uganda with computers. It included all types of schools: from
male/female-only to mixed schools, from poor to rich, from urban to
rural. Schools intervened not only as targets of the final product, but
also at the pre-testing and pilot stages. WIDE was 'a small sexual
health and training office of young Ugandan trainers'.[^09chapter06_17] The *Family
Planning Association* (FPA) used to have clinics throughout Uganda that
supported people in SRH issues. *Straight Talk* provided online
counselling on SRH. *NairoBits* was a digital design school for young
people from slum areas in Nairobi founded by Butterfly Works in 2000.
The trainers at NairoBits were themselves youth from the slums who
became web-designers and teachers. NairoBits was in charge of adapting
the pilot program developed in Uganda into Kenya urban areas.

In addition to these, other mediators emerge when considering how WSWM
worked on field. First, the WSWM software environment itself was a
mediator: on one hand, 'by promoting self-esteem and gender equality and
by empowering young people with information and skills regarding their
(sexual and reproductive) rights, the curriculum *supports* young people
and in particular young women in helping them to safeguard and enjoy
their own sexual and reproductive health'.[^09chapter06_18] On the other hand, the
software was an adjutant for teachers, too, as it helped them to connect
to their students: 'for teachers in schools it is new approach to
education, that gives them the chance to actually reach their students
and talk about important life issues'.[^09chapter06_19]

Second, teachers were also mobilized as professionals evaluating the
project. In the submission, quotations by teachers that run the program
in their classes were reported:

> quotes: Alex Okwaput (teacher Bishops Senior, Mukono District and
> teacher co-ordinator of WSWM): "Using WSWM changed my whole teaching
> and style in my other classes". Alandi Marion (teacher at Moroto SS):
> "Do you know what? Guess, during our presentation today one of our
> students was so excited that he laughed and opened his mouth so widely
> that his jaws could not close back to normal. Can you imagine
> that?".[^09chapter06_20]

Third, students that had finished their course acted as facilitators for
the new students. Some of the trainers were themselves young from the
slums that had become web-designers. In the submission, this
organizational model was labelled 'experiential learning' and was
intended to transform former learners into mediators playing 'an active
role in expanding the program to as many others as possible'. This form
of knowledge transfer based on the proliferation of mediators is very
similar to that of hackers' communities. As in FLOSS development
communities, it is peers and not hierarchical figures that translate
knowledge in an informal way.[^09chapter06_21]

What is striking in this project is exactly the number and assortment of
the mediators mobilized to reach the goal of 'giving young people self
confidence and control over their own lives'.[^09chapter06_22] Public schools,
foundations, clinics, NGOs, counselling services are assembled with
software, students, artists, peer facilitators, people from the slums in
an aggregate that blends formal institutions with informal ties.

The last case is *canal\*ACCESSIBLE*, a project dealing with the
creation of geo-referenced cartographies of urban places presenting
obstacles for the disabled.[^09chapter06_23] The project -- which was awarded the
Golden Nica in 2006 -- allowed movement-impaired people to send real
time pictures of inaccessible locations to a website, by means of mobile
phones equipped with cameras. Every multimedia item was geo-referenced,
so that it could be included into a map of the city, available online.

The system was not only aimed at disabled people, but also at other
discriminated groups that lacked possibilities of self-expression (e.g.,
taxi drivers in Mexico City; young gipsies in Lleida y León; prostitutes
in Madrid). According to the project's submission, indeed having the
possibility to achieve a means for self-expression would allow
minorities to by-pass mainstream media representations about them:

> The project is based on the possibility of giving voice and presence
> on the Internet to groups that suffer discrimination. It is about
> providing mobile communication technology to these groups so that they
> can express themselves on the Internet, without having to wait for the
> representaion that the mainstream means of communication give of them.
> It is the affected people themselves who explain who they are and what
> their expectations are. [^09chapter06_24]

Mainstream media are thus (anti-)mediators that translate the
discriminated groups into their representations. On the contrary, mobile
devices cannot be said to be mediators in their own right. They do not
affect the output in any way, but are seen as mere channels transporting
images from the urban space to the internet website.

More multifaceted considerations are required when it comes to internet
and the web. Throughout the application internet is seen as the final
platform where maps are published. Under this perspective, it acts as an
intermediary, whose presence does not trigger further actions. However,
things change in the 'Lessons learned' section:

> when a discriminated group, that is not accustomed to being listened
> to, obtains the possibility of expressing itself on the Internet
> through mobile phones, the first thing that happens is that it does
> not find what contents to communicate. However, gradually each group
> has found the topics that most affect it and has also organized itself
> into sub-groups dedicated to each channel of communication, with
> contents agreed on in the regular meetings. In the end, they have
> always managed to articulate and publish specific thematic channels of
> the group.[^09chapter06_25]

Here, it is the possibility of self-expression on the internet that
enacts groups by stimulating not only the production of contents, but
also the acknowledgement of the most pressing concerns and the
organization of the editorial staff. It should be noticed that this
theory of action -- it is the possibility to access a medium as
producers that triggers enacts new actors -- is based on a mass-media
pattern of interaction where 'self-expression' is usually hampered by
the broadcasting form of transmission.

All in all, this project shows a rather short chain of action. Although
it recognized the transformative potentials of mass-media, it conceives
of ICT, and mobile phones in particular, mainly as intermediaries.

Summing up the results of the four analyses, there emerge two
macro-types of digital communities aiming at empowering disadvantaged
populations.

<small>Table 12 - Summary of the theories of action associated with
'empowerment'</small>

This comparison shows that the source of boundaries is a crucial
element. It is correlated to the theory of action that underpins the
development of a community. Projects addressing disadvantaged groups
whose existence appeals to administrative or statistical boundaries tend
to display specific narratives of empowerment. According to these
narratives, target groups are pushed to acquire ICT skills in order to
enter the information age, and ICT skills and digital access are
conceived of as a goal in itself. The relationship between digital
technologies and social ties is often one of cause-and-effect: access to
technical facilities (and occasionally literacy courses) is supposed to
immediately lead to better living conditions. As a consequence, the
chain that transports agency is rather short, with few mediators and
some intermediaries. In these accounts, ICT are conceived of as
'technological facilities' that act as intermediaries.

Furthermore, in similar accounts the roles of Addresser and Addressee
are easily distinguishable: there is one entity -- the project designer
-- that acts as sender in a communication process (classes, service
provisioning, etc.), and a group which is supposed to be the receiver of
this process. In *Akshaya*, for instance, entrepreneurs implement the
e-centres and the local communities are the target group which benefits
from the activity of the entrepreneurs. Similarly, in *Proyecto Cyberela
-- Radio Telecentros*, after the advent of digital technologies the role
of Cemina as core team got distinguished from that of the radio-makers,
who stopped to act as local leaders and became addressees of Cemina's
classes. In both cases, group identities pre-exist the course of action
and boundaries are stabilized: the community has been black-boxed.

The other model is exemplified by *Tonga.Online.* This project does not
deal with statistical boundaries, but rather borrows its source of
identity from the cultural heritage. Here, ICT are seen as one of the
many types of mediators participating in the course of action. Mediators
are not only human beings, but also digital devices and traditional
music. Every mediator introduces a bifurcation in the course of action
and triggers new participants. The chain that transports agency extends
in many directions and includes also a journalist mobilized in order to
make the group exist. The empowered community that results is enacted
through this concatenation of action. In this dynamic techno-social
assemblage, distinguishing the project designer from the target becomes
meaningless.

Lastly, *The World Starts With Me* locates among these two types of
digital community. Like the first type, it appeals to statistics in
order to legitimize the focus on disadvantaged youth and conceives of
computers and technical facilities as intermediaries that may be
replaced by paper and pencil. On the other hand, many mediators -- both
human and machinic, institutional and informal -- are involved and the
acquisition of ICT skills is not seen only as a goal, but as a
competence that triggers other courses of action. In addition, actors'
enactment is explicit: through the experiential learning model, former
students may become peer facilitators, that is, mediators in their own
right.

## 6.3 'Free' as in 'Freedom': When Digital Communities Become Movements

Distinguishing different typologies of digital communities is less
clear-cut when it comes to communities that appeal to freedom as the
source of their action. This is the case of projects like the
*Electronic Frontier Foundation,* the *Free Software Foundation* and
*Telestreet-New Global Vision (NGV)*, which appeal to *freedom* as the
source of their boundaries, and entail a political dimension of their
action. Looking carefully at their submissions, one could nevertheless
notice some minor differences that are expected to lead to different
communitarian typologies.

For the *Electronic Frontier Foundation* (EFF)[^09chapter06_26] -- champion of the
independence of cyberspace from the brick-and-mortar world, as seen in
section 1.1 -- 'freedom in the networked world' acts as the main
principle for action. The Foundation's objective is 'to defend freedom
of expression, innovation and privacy on the electronic frontier', in
the name of the 'public interest in digital rights on a global
level'.[^09chapter06_27]

Freedom is crucial also for the *Free Software Foundation* (FSF)*,*[^09chapter06_28]
whose objective is 'to achieve software freedom to cooperate' (*Free
Software Foundation* submission). However, a difference may be noticed
in FSF's and EFF's accounts. For FSF, the appeal to freedom alone does
not justify action. FSF does not address freedom as an abstract concept,
but as the practical 'computer users rights to use, copy, study, modify
and redistribute computer programs'. In other words, freedom is not so
much valuable in itself, but because it is a condition for cooperation
and community making:

> FSF\'s founder, Richard Stallman, had participated in the cooperating
> community of the 70s while working at MIT. When this community
> collapsed under pressure for commercialization, he decided to build a
> new community of cooperation. However, with the proprietary software
> that had become the norm in the 80s, cooperation was illegal or
> impossible. To redistribute the software verbatim is illegal; to
> improve it without a copy of the source code is impossible. To have a
> community would require replacing that proprietary software with
> \"free software\"\-\-\--software that users are free to change and
> redistribute (and run).[^09chapter06_29]

Community and cooperation are thus the actual values that trigger FSF's
agency, and around which its identity is built.

The *Telestreet* submission[^09chapter06_30] conceives of 'freedom to produce
communication' as the 'necessary condition for the development of an
active, critic and conscious way of being citizen' (*Telestreet*
submission). Its goal is 'creating relational networks and active
citizenship through an integrated use of communication means': the
principles around which the community takes shape are constituted by
appeals to active citizenship, not to freedom alone.

This differentiation between an understanding of freedom for freedom's
sake vs. freedom as a condition for cooperation or active citizenship
could look like hair-splitting. Nonetheless, it entails further
differences. For instance, a further distinction concerns the
anti-groups mentioned in the accounts. While for EFF the opponent that
limits freedom is the United States Secret Service,[^09chapter06_31] Stallman's
early community 'collapsed under pressure for commercialization', and
Telestreet tend to identify the anti-group with mainstream broadcasting
networks.[^09chapter06_32] That is, EFF re-enacts early cyberculture's opposition to
the nation-state, while FSF and Telestreet attribute the reduction of
freedom to market logics.

These differences correspond to different types of artefacts involved by
each of the three communities. EFF shows a fairly deterministic theory
of action of technology and society: 'ICT are transforming society and
empowering us as speakers, citizens, creators and consumers'.[^09chapter06_33] In
reproposing the opposition between the digital domain and formal
politics ('the power of the Net can trump the power of vested
politics'), EFF invokes informational resources as agents of change.
However, it is not clear how blog posts, podcasts, online videos, and
the newsletter are expected to trigger change: 'EFF works through our
website, blog posts,and podcasts, online video projects, "action alerts"
that encourage personal political involvement, our email newsletter, the
promotion of debates and other interactive events, and online guides and
other information for writers and artists who want to express themselves
digitally'.[^09chapter06_34]

With the exception of action alerts that endow users with a will to act
('encourage personal political involvement'), information resources
participate in the course of action as intermediaries. Even when it is
pointed out that 'the website remains the home base for coordinating and
disseminating information to our community', it is not clear *how* the
website is supposed to transform the input. Also *YouTube, MySpace* and
social networking sites are seen as intermediaries to make EFF's message
available to a wider audience.

EFF itself appears as a stabilized institution. There are different
levels of participation: EFF core staff (made of coordinators,
activists, 'techies', artists, policy analysts, attorneys), EFF members,
newsletter subscribers, users of the 'Action Center'. While being open
to subscribers, a similar structure quite easily allows to mark the
boundaries of the EFF assemblage, so that external Addressees are
clearly defined as 'those who create and communicate in the electronic
world, \[...\] those who are interested in technology policy covering
free expression, innovation and privacy'.[^09chapter06_35]

Compared to EFF's, FSF's submission shows a greater heterogeneity of
mediators and does not mention intermediaries. What strikes in this
submission is the equivalence of social and technical actors. The GNU
operative system, for instance, was developed in order to react to the
monopoly of proprietary software that -- making cooperation illegal or
impossible -- used to hamper community making efforts: 'GNU is the only
operating system ever developed specifically for the sake of giving
computer users the freedom to cooperate.' [^09chapter06_36]

While GNU is a mediator, it also activates other mediators, like the FSF
itself. The FSF was founded in 1985 'to raise funds for GNU development,
and for promoting users\' freedom to share and change software'. In
turn, FSF acts as a trusted copyright holder supporting a wider global
community of developers, a 'legal enforcer of the freedoms individuals
in the community want protected as their work is distributed'.[^09chapter06_37]

Another crucial actor is the kernel Linux that since 1992 has been
co-developed with GNU, thus initiating the first completely free
operating system. If Linux could be integrated into GNU, it is because
it was released under the GNU General Public License. As a consequence,
the number of mediators includes also those licenses (GNU GPL, GNU LGPL,
GNU GFDL) that 'guarantee the freedom to copy, modify, and distribute
the software and the manuals released under them'.[^09chapter06_38]

Furthermore, the GNU project owes much of its existence to the
'thousands of volunteer developers around the globe'. The peculiar
characteristic of this community is that every software user is a
potential mediator, since she can write code or documentation, improve
it, engage in political activism or simply diffuse knowledge about free
software:

Any free software user can contribute to a project, regardless of that
user\'s educational background, socioeconomic status, or geographical
location. All that matters is the ability to write code or documentation
and the willingness to share the result and what was learned in its
creation. Volunteers who don\'t write code or documentation help by
engaging in political activism and telling other people about free
software, using the structures and campaigns run by the FSF as their
focus.[^09chapter06_39]

In the FSF's submission, the boundaries of the community blur to the
point that it is difficult to distinguish an outside. The proliferation
of mediators is potentially infinite, as infinite is the number of
potential users/developers of free software. This point is explicitly
addressed in the 'statement of reasons' section of the submission:

The GNU Project, through developing a free software operating system and
the GNU General Public License, built the free software community as we
know it today. Just think about all of the various communities on the
Web\-\--most, if not all, were made possible by the ethical and
practical idea of free software and the freedom to cooperate. Wikipedia,
last year\'s winner of this prize, is licensed under the GFDL.
MediaWiki, the software it runs on, is released under the GPL. These
projects, like many others, draw their contributors to a large extent
from the free software community. We cannot claim credit for all of the
projects out there and all of the work that went into them, but our role
in intentionally building this community, in writing the licenses that
these projects predominantly use, and in providing the space for this
amazing growth to continue, made it possible to do them.[^09chapter06_40]

With the Free Software Foundation, the digital community becomes a
movement. With this, I do not mean that it is no longer an assemblage,
but rather that it is the quintessence of a techno-social assemblage
that strives to remain fluid, to not be black-boxed. This is possible
because the 'ethical and practical ideas' did not remain abstract, but
got embodied into software and cooperation procedures that may be
unceasingly modified.

With Telestreet, the online community as a movement is enacted through
low- and high-resolution technologies. Here it is not so much the
distinction between developer and user that must be overcome, but that
between sender and receiver of pre-digital broadcast media.

> Telestreet tactically partakes reality, and by so doing every citizen
> reaches the opportunity to turn from passive viewer into an active
> subject of an utterance. Actually, Telestreet\'s approach to

> new spaces of community, in the neighbourhood as on the Web. Indeed,
> it is the precondition that the relevant technologies are widely
> accessible that allows the \*do-it-yourself\* concept to spread and
> hundreds of micro TVs to raise up.[^09chapter06_41]

As for FSF, by providing an 'approach to communication' Telestreet
itself is a mediator that 'induces' someone to do something, supported
by the new accessibility of media technologies. Since everyone may set
up her own TV broadcaster adapting the Telestreet model, the boundaries
between senders and receivers tend to blur. Given the reusability of the
know-how and the low-cost of the technologies needed, the quantity and
quality of potential mediators is infinite. For instance, local
authorities 'implemented the Telestreet project by involving their
community members'.

Since broadcasting without governmental licenses is illegal, Telestreet
activates mediators borrowed from legislative ranks, as well. Telestreet
invokes Article 21 of Italian Constitution on freedom of expression to
claim the constitutionality of an initiative that aims to assert media
access rights. Also members of Parliament are involved, with the role of
introducing the issue of public access to media-making to the
Parliament's agenda.

Further actors come from the range of technology. At first sight,
Telestreet's theory of action may recall technologically deterministic
positions conceiving access to media as an empowering factor per se:
'the result is the birth of a citizenship that becomes active as soon as
it takes over the most passive-making communicative tool \[television\],
the one where political and symbolic strategies of Power are greatly at
stake in Italy'.[^09chapter06_42] When taken as single entities, media are
black-boxed, seen as mere channels to transport information. Satellite
television and the web, for instance, are conceived of as intermediaries
to merely 'transmit' Telestreet's video productions, without affecting
the final product. Similarly, the website is described in technical and
functional terms, but no considerations are made on *how* it shapes
relationships.[^09chapter06_43]

Nonetheless, things get more complex when media are combined with other
media, or when disassembled into their components. For instance,
internet is seen as a mediator that enables social networks when its
decentralized nature is combined with the socializing power of the DIY
television: 'it is just combining these two means that it is possible to
create social networks'.[^09chapter06_44] Similarly, once it has been
reverse-engineered by turning the receiver into a transmitter, broadcast
television stops to be 'a tool for exclusion' and is conceived of as a
powerful mediator. It 'stimulates creativity of people coming from
widely different social classes', 'enables people to take advantage of
their rights', 'gives the chance' to passive users to turn into 'active
subjects of communication', 'bridges the Digital Divide regarding age as
well as gender'.[^09chapter06_45]

In summary, if the black box *par excellence* may act as an agent of
transformation, it is because it gets decomposed into its elements:
transmitter, modulator, amplifier, 'shadow cones', cameras, VHS player,
mixer, etc.[^09chapter06_46] If having access to media is sufficient for citizens to
become active, it is not because ICT deterministically 'empowers' them,
but because they acquire competences through the practice of
manipulating, hacking and reverse-engineering media technology. In other
words, the DIY ethics itself acts as a mediator that embeds concepts
into artefacts in a course of action whose ultimate goal is transforming
audience into citizenship. Table 13 summarizes the above analyses.

<small>Table 13 - Comparison among EFF, FSF, Telestreet</small>

In all the three cases analyzed, the digital community participating in
the competition is part of a wider global community pursuing
respectively freedom in the digital realm, free cooperation in software
development, and freedom of expression as a condition to promote active
citizenship. Nevertheless, it should be noticed that for EFF freedom is
something to be defended, for FSF a value to be achieved, for Telestreet
a right to struggle for. That is, according to the EFF's account freedom
is something achieved in the past that is to be preserved. According to
FSF and Telestreet submissions, conversely, freedom is a process
associated with the proliferation of mediators, that is, users that
adopt the DIY approach and modify technology according to their needs.

Furthermore, while EFF addresses audiences that are external to its
multi-level organization, by including users as mediators FSF and
Telestreet bring openness to its extreme consequences, to the point that
the boundaries of the community liquefy into a movement. This is
possible because ideas are embedded into artefacts that can be modified
by users themselves: code and licenses in the case of FSF, broadcasting
and web technology for Telestreet. In this regard, FSF and Telestreet
re-enact net art's critique of the author Vs. spectator distinction
(section 1.3), as well as mediactivism's attempts of techno-social
organization through web platforms (section 1.4).

## 6.4 The Web as Mediator. Web 2.0 Tools and User-generated-Contents

The novelty introduced by communities like FSF and Telestreet concerns
the fact that users and technologies enter the course of action as
mediators in their own right. Another project that goes in this
direction is *Overmundo*, a Web 2.0 platform that won the Golden Nica in
2007. It's goal is 'to promote the emergence of the Brazilian culture,
in all its complexity and geographical diversity'.[^09chapter06_47] [^09chapter06_48] This need
comes from the lack of adequate coverage of local cultural scenes by
mainstream media, which tend to focus on the two largest Brazilian
cities. Artists, journalists, bloggers and cultural groups from
throughout Brazil are expected to post articles, pictures, movies, music
on this Web 2.0 platform, thus getting over isolation and achieving
national visibility.

Figure 17 summarizes the actors identified in the analysis of the
submission (green labels indicate proper names). What characterizes this
project's submission is the attentive account of how the *Overmundo*
community has been constituted as the result of a long chain of actions
mainly embedded in software.

![](imgs/Figure17.png)

<small>Figure 17 - Visualization of the Overmundo network of mediators</small>

Initially, twenty-seven contributors (one in each of the Brazilian
states) were hired by the designer group to regularly post about
cultural developments in their states. As proper mediators, 'Overminas'
and 'Overmanos' were also in charge of activating other users in their
states to start contributing to the website. Furthermore, this initial
group set the 'rules of the game', the quality standards to which the
subsequent contributions had to adapt.

The Overmundo web platform was tasked with shaping the workflow whereby
users could post, decide the priority of items on the homepage, evaluate
contributions, determine the duration of a post. It was charged with the
task of mediating between the main goal (i.e., achieve 100% of
users-produced contents) and the need for a quality control system:

> What types of technological tools should be used to achieve this goal?
> Should the content be freely editable such as the Wikipedia? Should it
> be edited by a centralized editorial board, such as the Korean
> newspaper OhMyNews? In order to answer these questions, Overmundo had
> to keep in mind very clearly what was the problem it was trying to
> solve. The choice of one particular model instead of another had to be
> made keeping in sight the specific goals to achieve, and the true
> possibility of building a comprehensive community pursuing the same
> goals.[^09chapter06_49]

For example, the workflow included an initial 'Editing Line' function,
which kept new posts in quarantine before publication, so that authors
and other users could modify it. After quarantine, items used to pass to
the 'Voting Line', where users could vote the article. The voting system
made use of 'Overpoints', points associated to positive votes. The
position of an article on the homepage was determined by the amount of
Overpoints. Finally, users' votes were weighted on the basis of a
reputation system called 'Karma'. Users with more Karma points used to
have more Overpoints and thus more editorial power.

This workflow exemplifies Shirky's point that 'social software is
political science in executable form'[^09chapter06_50], as well as the notion of
'script'.[^09chapter06_51] The Overmundo platform assigned tasks and decisional
power to some actors, while it limited others. In other words, political
decisions about representation and reputation were embedded in code,
which established the procedures whereby the community could assemble.
Summing up, the Overmundo submission described in details the actions
that brought to the emergence of the community. By so doing, it showed
how the digital community is the result -- and not the condition -- of
distributed agency.

Two further winning communities focused on user-generated contents:
*dotSUB* and *Open Clothes.* dotSUB, which won an Award of Distinction
in 2007, is a browser-based facility designed to create video subtitles
in any language. It is based on a publicly accessible database of .sub
files, while the original video can be stored everywhere online. This
project's goal is to facilitate cross-cultural communication by means of
visual language. Video is seen as an agent of change: 'video has become
the creative medium of choice. It is transformative and unique. It
encourages a kind of creative energy that fosters new thought and new
creativity and new pathways for identifying and solving problems'
[^09chapter06_52].[^09chapter06_53]

However, in order to allow video to express its universal creative
potential on a global scale, the problem of footage availability in
multiple languages must be addressed. Here is where dotSUB facilities
enter the chain of action by providing 'tools that change language
barriers into cultural bridges'. The project's theory of action is
explicit: 'by putting seamless video subtitling technology into the
hands of individuals, *dotSUB* tools make stories from every culture
accessible to every culture, fostering intercultural experience,
communication, and connection'.[^09chapter06_54] However, *dotSUB*'s functioning is
not described in details in the submission, and the tool is described
more as an intermediary that translates stories from one culture into
another, than as a mediator which triggers new action. As a matter of
fact, there is no reference to how the platform actually works as a
means whereby the community is kept assembled.

Lastly, *Open Clothes* aims to create a network of producers, users and
contractors in the garment industry.[^09chapter06_55] Echoing the discussion in
chapters 2 and 3, this project is characterized by its decoupling of the
notion of 'community' from any communalistic intent. Indeed, it defines
its community in non-essentialist terms, as a 'clothes production
system' involving tailors ('those who make' clothes), users ('those who
wear') and professional contractors who economically support the system
and extract value from it. To explain the project's idea of community,
the submission uses the metaphor of a tree: tailors constitute the
trunk, users are the branches and contractors the roots:

> \"Open-Clothes.com\" community is compared to a tree. First, wooden
> \"trunk\" is the making-clothes network of \"those who make.\" The
> function of community is substantial from information exchange to work
> sale as if annual rings may be piled up. The network which supports
> activity from beginners to experts in connection with making dress as
> an individual is formed. Then, it is a \"branch\" bears (sic) fruits,
> the works born from the network of \"those who make\". \"Those who
> wears\" gathers in quest of \"clothes with stories.\" \[...\]
> Moreover, a \"root\" is required to suck up nutrition and send to a
> trunk. The cooperation with the professional contractor who become
> (sic) a foundation supporting activity of \"those who make\" is
> indispensable to making clothes. Then, in Open-Clothes.com, the common
> production system of \"those who make\", and \"the contractors who
> make\" is built.[^09chapter06_56]

The boundaries of this community are constituted by a common interest in
clothes. Creating an assemblage to make and buy personalized clothes is
the main goal of this project, that relies on 'technology to make the
clothes environment' open. Despite its emphasis on technology, the
account mentions technology only in terms of cause-and-effect, as one of
ICT inducing the aggregation of individuals. Therefore, while showing
how human actors can contribute to the making of the community, no space
is left to explain how technological artefacts work, nor to describe how
this assemblage is made durable.

Summing up, this chapter has focused on the role attributed to artefacts
whereby groups are kept together. By so doing, it has tried to describe
the theories of action underpinning the rationale of techno-social
assemblages labelled as digital/online communities. It is evident that
those theories of action constitute a multi-faceted landscape, and no
univocal relationship between technological and social elements can be
singled out. From time to time information technologies, knowledge and
infrastructures can be conceived of as tools, goals, supporters. They
can empower established social actors in rather deterministic accounts,
they can become almost invisible tools, or they can trigger new actors
themselves.

Despite this heterogeneity, the analysis suggests it is possible to
identify two main types of communities. On one hand, narratives of
empowerment which tend to address the relationship between digital
technologies and social ties as one of cause-and-effect show a short
chain of action, with few mediators and more intermediaries.
Paradoxically, in these accounts ICT themselves are conceived of as
'technological facilities' that act as intermediaries. Such communities
tend to be stabilized and appeal to administrative or statistical
boundaries. The roles of Addresser and Addressee are clearly separated,
and identities pre-exist to the course of action.

The other model does not deal with statistical boundaries, but rather
borrows its source of identity from cultural heritage or other
qualitatively defined origins. Here, both humans and artefacts can be
full-blown mediators participating in the course of action. The chain
that transports agency is long and extends in many directions. For
similar unstable techno-social assemblages, distinguishing designers
from users becomes very difficult, if not meaningless. Community
boundaries blur to the point that it is difficult to distinguish an
outside. At one extreme of this *continuum*, community boundaries
liquefy into movements.

All in all, similar accounts show that online sociability, engagement,
and eventually communal ties are only possible because of situated
material entanglements. In the case of *Overmundo*, for example, human
interaction is allowed by a voting platform that establishes roles,
criteria, and procedures for participation. This evidence further
questions sociological theory postulating the responsibility of modern
artefacts in the demise of sociability and communitarian bounds (see
section 4.3). More than marking the end of social and political
engagement, digital artefacts mediate different types of sociability. If
deterministic explanations can be found, they depend not on artefacts
*per sé*, but on how their role is accounted for: either as
intermediaries, or as mediators.

Finally, one limit of the previous analysis is its focus on textual
accounts. Indeed, story-telling provides one possible lens to capture
fleeting assemblages.[^09chapter06_57] At the same time, I agree that there can be
other lenses, that make use of different materials. The next chapter
therefore tries to make sense of techno-social assemblages by addressing
different types of accounts.

[^09chapter06_1]: "Noli me tangere" ("do not touch me") was the Latin transation of
    the words spoken by Jesus to Mary Magdalene when she recognized him
    after resurrection. It is a topos in Western culture, as various
    paintings, novels and sculptures were so titled.

[^09chapter06_3]: According to the French scholar, since the list of groupings
    composed of social aggregates is potentially infinite, it is easier
    for social enquirers to substitute it with the more abstract list of
    the elements which are always present in controversies about groups.
    These elements are: 1) a spokesperson who speaks for the group
    existence, defines it and argues for its uniqueness; 2) some
    anti-groups that can be compared with the group of interest, so that
    its consistency may be emphasized; 3) an element that originates the
    group boundaries, so that they are rendered durable and taken for
    granted. Usually *limes* are provided by appeals to tradition, law,
    nature, history, freedom, etc.; 4) professionals (social scientists,
    journalists, statisticians) who speak for the group existence. Any
    account by these professionals is part of what makes a group exist
    or disappear. On the generative role of journalists and pollsters in
    making social actors (for instance the 'public-opinion') exist, see
    also E. Landowski, *La société réfléchie*, Paris: Seuil, 1989.

[^09chapter06_5]: Addresser and Addressee designate the two subjects of a process of
    communication. They correspond to the 'sender' and the 'receiver' of
    Information Theory, although this latter approach does not take into
    consideration the dynamic constitution of the subjects of
    communication. See the comparison between HCI, on one side, and
    sociology of technology and semiotics, on the other side, in chapter
    5. While according to the first approach the subjects of
    communication pre-exist to the interactive process, according to the
    second school subjectivity gets installed *through* the
    communicational process. I cannot account here for the immense
    literature dealing with subjectivity and communication from 1950s
    onwards. As Mattelart, *Histoire de la société de l'information*,
    has pointed out, this literature traces indeed the history (and
    controversies) of what is meant by 'Information Society'. I thus
    only signal the origin of Informational Theory introducing the
    concepts of 'sender' and 'receiver' from a mechanical perspective in
    C. Shannon and W. Weaver, *A Mathematical Theory of Communication*,
    Urbana-Champaign, Ill.: University of Illinois Press, 1949.

    On the opposite side, post-structuralist and materialist authors
    have seen language as an action that transforms subjectivity
    *during* action*.* See for example, J. C. Coquet, *La quête du sens.
    Le langage en question*, Paris: PUF, 1997; L. A. Suchman, *Plans and
    Situated Actions: The Problem of Human-Machine Communication,* New
    York: Cambridge University Press, 1987; K. M. Barad, *Meeting the
    Universe Halfway. Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and
    Meaning*, Durham and London: Duke University Press, 2007.

    one single version that will close the discussion... Articulations,
    on the other hand, may easily proliferate without ceasing to
    register differences. On the contrary, the more contrasts you add,
    the more differences and mediations you become sensible to.' B.

[^09chapter06_9]: What a better definition for the term 'stakeholder' than 'someone
    who participates in a course of action'? From the synonymy of
    stakeholder and mediator, the anti-democratic character of the use
    of this term follows. By using 'stakeholder', in fact, one may refer
    to an assemblage and still avoid making explicit who/what that
    assemblage in made of. Since 'politics' refers in half part to the
    procedures whereby groups are assembled and mediators legitimized to
    take part in that assembly, the use of the term 'stakeholder'
    relieves the one who uses it from publicly arguing who and what is
    to be included in that assembly. Conversely, in the Tonga.Online
    submission stakeholders are endowed with a list of figurations
    (pupils, fishermen, etc.).

[^09chapter06_21]: See discussion about FSF below. Even if I cannot account here for
    the vast literature dealing with ICT and pedagogy, it should be
    noticed that the WSWM's approach to teaching sounds close to
    pedagogical theories underpinning the so called 'blended-learning'
    model. The 'socio-cultural constructivism' paradigm, in fact,
    extends the insights of constructivism into 'digital pedagogy' and
    focuses on the situated, interactive and informal components of the
    learning process. See J. S. Bruner, *Acts of Meaning*, Cambridge,
    Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1990; , H. Gardner, *Frames of

[^09chapter06_30]: Telestreet was the Italian network of independent micro TV
    stations air-broadcasting on a neighbourhood scale. Telestreet used
    to integrate low- and high-tech artefacts in media making, analogue
    air-broadcasting (at the local level) and digital networking (for
    organization, footage distribution and decision-making at the
    national scale). Telestreet won an Award of Distinction in 2005
    together with *New Global Vision*, a video archive platform
    initiated in 2001 during the G8 in Geneva, which used to distribute
    independent footage via peer-to-peer networks. Telestreet's and
    NGV's submissions are reported in Annex A (Documents 8 and 9).

[^09chapter06_31]: 'The Electronic Frontier Foundation was founded in July of 1990
    in response to a basic threat to free expression. As part of an
    investigation into \"hackers,\" the United States Secret Service
    seized all electronic equipment and copies of an upcoming book from
    a games book publisher named Steve Jackson Games, even though the
    business had no connection to the \"hacking.\" When the computers
    were finally returned, employees noticed that all of the electronic
    mail that had been stored on the company\'s electronic bulletin
    board computer had been individually accessed and deleted.' *EFF*

[^09chapter06_32]: 'The Italian community of media-activists immediately felt the
    need to create a new tool to publish and share all the video
    materials that has been produced after those terrible days, video
    and images which tells other stories from mainstream media, as well
    as documentaries which has been censored by official TV broadcasts.'
    *NGV* submission, 2005. 'Over 60% of Italians access information
    exclusively through two mainstream broadcasting networks (Rai and
    Mediaset), which, as a consequence, have the power to mould

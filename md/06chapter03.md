# 3. IN SEARCH OF COMMUNITY

By arguing that the anarchic internet prairie has turned into a
battlefield, the previous chapter has shown how over the last decade the
utopias that digital communitarians inherited from libertarian
cyberculture revealed their empirical inconsistency. The opposition
between lay citizens and big powers that Rheingold and the WELL
community inherited from cybernetic culture faced the hype of crowds
voluntarily contributing their contents and personal data to internet
corporations. Instead of aggregating and exchanging information on
peer-to-peer networks, more and more people rely upon few corporations
in order to socialize online. New Communalists' decentralized
organizational paradigm as well as the ethics of self-entrepreneurship
and informal labour outsources content-production to amateurs, while
shrinking resources for professionals. In this light, the gift economy
fostered by academic networks and FLOSS communities has sustained the
business model of new internet powers who gain revenues by promoting old
brands through user-generated-contents. On a different level, early
academic and hacker confidence about the uncontrollability of the Net
faced geo-ID technologies for law enforcement, and sorting technologies
that challenged privacy rights.

In summary, three early myths have been confuted by these developments:
an imagined coalition between the rebels and entrepreneurs of the net,
and related dreams of grassroots cultural alliances; the vision of the
net as an uncontrollable space detached from the brick-and-mortar world,
not subject to governments' sovereignty; and the belief that the sharing
of information would empower individuals and communities against
governmental and commercial powers.

Such dystopic evidence has led many internet scholars to acknowledge
that the utopia of an internet rooted in communitarian harmony has left
room for conflicts and competitions not too different from the ones
affecting the brick-and-mortar world. Many wonder whether we can still
talk about internet communitarianism, and, if so, under what conditions.

This chapter attempts to engage with social sciences scholars and media
theorists who have formulated different responses to this question. On
one hand, there are those who highlight the structural variations in the
wider notion of 'community' in late modernity. On the other hand, other
authors argue for new forms of communal ties on the net, on condition
that the communitarian effort gets rid of the libertarian paradigm.

## 3.1 From Groups to Networks

The conviction that communitarian ties have been facing structural
changes is shared by two of the most influential social scientists
shaping the field of internet studies: Castells and Wellman. Yet their
position is not only focused on online communities, nor is it limited in
time to the evolution of the internet, rather, it tackles deeper
societal transformations.

By using the expression 'networked individualism', Castells and Wellman
call into question the possibility of identifying communitarian ties
online. More precisely, they both argue that the traditional notion of
online community as bounded groups have been replaced by networks of
individuals interacting online in one-to-one patterns of communication.
In Castells' 'space of flows', the individual is the hub of different
kinds of streams that move from the place to the subject and vice versa.

According to Castells, social relationships are over determined by the
technical organization of the means of production brought about by
informational capitalism. That is, sociability is moulded in the shape
that the dominant mode of production takes in the Information Age. Since
the dominant form of organization of informational capitalism is the
network, social relations reflect a similar structure.[^06chapter03_1] 'Networked
individualism' is thus a specific model of sociability rooted in the
relationship between labour and the networked enterprise typical of the
Information Age:

> Now the dominant trend in the evolution of social relationships in our
> societies is the rise of individualism, in all its manifestations.
> \[...\] Social scientists, such as Giddens, Putnam, Wellman, Beck,
> Carnoy, and myself, have emphasized the emergence of a new system of
> social relationships centered on the individual. After the transition
> from the predominance of primary relationships (embodied in families
> and communities) to secondary relationships (embodied in
> associations), the new, dominant pattern seems to be built on what
> could be called 'tertiary relationships', or what Wellman calls
> 'personalized communities,' embodied in me-centered networks. It
> represents the privatization of sociability. This individualized
> relationship to society is a specific pattern of sociability, not a
> psychological attribute. It is rooted, first of all, in the
> individualization of the relationship between capital and labor,
> between workers and the work process in the network enterprise.[^06chapter03_2]

Me-centred networks can establish themselves offline and/or online: it
is not the dichotomy of material vs. virtual that concerns Castells the
most, rather the opposition between traditional (and somewhat
mythological) territorial communities structured around dwelling
proximity and social ties based on cultural affinity. According to
Castells and other influential scholars he quotes, territoriality plays
a less and less relevant role in shaping social relationships in
advanced societies, being replaced instead by similarities of
interests.[^06chapter03_3] [^06chapter03_4]In particular, Castells tends to associate the
territorial type of relationship with the label 'community' and the
cultural one with the term 'network'. As a consequence, Castells argues,
we are witnessing the substitution of communities with networks as the
primary form of social interaction:

> communities, at least in the tradition of sociological research, were
> based on the sharing of values and social organization. Networks are
> built by the choices and strategies of social actors, be it
> individuals, families, or social groups. Thus, the major
> transformation of sociability in complex societies took place with the
> substitution of networks for spatial communities as major forms of
> sociability. [^06chapter03_5] [^06chapter03_6]

The principal model of sociability is thus constituted by a centre --
built around the household nucleus -- that spreads in many
non-territorial directions according to individuals' interests. Castells
tends to associate this kind of affinity-based ties with Wellman's 'weak
ties'.[^06chapter03_7]

If networked individualism is the model for both online and offline
sociability in the Information Age, according to Castells internet only
provides a material support for the spread of networked individualism as
the dominant form of sociability. While social networks based on weak
ties are not new, ICT have allowed them to become dominant. In so doing,
Castells distances himself from technologically deterministic
explanations and introduces a multi-causality model. Only once online
networks get stabilized into social practices, can they build virtual
communities.[^06chapter03_8] However, stable virtual communities like the WELL or
Nettime -- Castells adds -- are exceptions and it would be easier to
understand them if we used the term 'networks of sociability'.[^06chapter03_9]

Wellman shares with Castells some insights on networked individualism
that he further develops by focusing on the interplay between urban
space and social practices enabled by mobile media.[^06chapter03_10] He suggests
that research on online sociability should be carried on with attention
to a wider context investigating the transformation of sociability
patterns at large. According to Wellman, the proliferation of personal
networks happened well before the advent of ICT:
computer-mediated-communication (CMC) has only supported the emergence
of individualized networks as the dominant form of social organization.

This approach allows Wellman to distance himself from cybercultural
utopias, and to empirically examine the transformations triggered by
computerized communication networks. Like Castells, Wellman carefully
avoids mono-causality and technological determinism and outlines a
retro-active mechanism to explain the relationship between technology
and society:

> the technological development of computer networks and the societal
> flourishing of social networks are now in a positive feedback loop.
> Just as the flexibility of less-bounded, spatially dispersed social
> networks creates demand for the world wide web and collaborative
> communication, the breathless development of computer networks
> nourishes societal transitions from little boxes to social networks.
> [^06chapter03_11]

In Wellman's approach, technology does not 'cause' social
transformations, but 'supports', 'enables', 'allows' them. Crucial in
this regard is the introduction of the concept of 'social affordances'
as 'the possibilities that technological changes afford for social
relations and social structure'.[^06chapter03_12] Notably, Wellman argues that
portability, ubiquitous computing, globalized connectivity, and
personalization are supporting the movement from place-to-place
communities to person-to-person communities.

Place-to-place interactions[^06chapter03_13] are centred on the household, where
visits and telephone calls are received. This pattern of sociability
links households and family nucleuses that are not in the same
neighbourhood: home is the base for relationships that are more
selective than the neighbourhood communities of the past. Furthermore,
being based on inter-household networks, place-to-place connectivity
creates a fluid system for accessing material and cognitive resources:
by switching among networks, people can use ties in one network to bring
resources to another one.[^06chapter03_14]

The place-to-place model of sociability has enabled communities of
affinity less constrained by territoriality yet it preserved some sense
of social context. Conversely, person-to-person connectivity drastically
reduces the sense of place. With 'person-to-person connectivity',
Wellman indicates an emerging pattern of sociability enabled by
innovations in communication technologies, notably by the development of
mobile ICT centred on the individual:

> when someone calls a telephone wired into the telephone network, the
> phone rings at the place, no matter which person is being called.
> Indeed, many place-to-place ties have connected households as much as
> individuals. By contrast, mobile phones afford a fundamental
> liberation from place, and they soon will be joined by wireless
> computers and personalized software. Their use shifts community ties
> from linking people-in-places to linking people wherever they are.
> Because the connection is to the person and not to the place, it
> shifts the dynamics of connectivity from places\--typically households
> or worksites\--to individuals.[^06chapter03_15]

The evolution from place-to-place to person-to-person connectivity
introduces the second aspect which Wellman's paradigm shares with
Castells'. Like Castells, Wellman conceives of the dichotomy between
territorial and de-territorialized social ties as the most pertinent
category for analysis, that cuts across the material/immaterial
dichotomy.[^06chapter03_16] He distinguishes, in fact, two main types of community:
spatially defined community vs. a socially defined one. They roughly
correspond to Castells' 'territorial community' and 'interest-based
network' respectively. Actually, Wellman identifies four main uses of
the term 'community', but he concentrates on only one: 'I define
"community" networks of interpersonal ties that provide sociability,
support, information, a sense of belonging, and social identity'.[^06chapter03_17]

According to Wellman,[^06chapter03_18] with the shift to mobile connectivity it is
the individual, and not the household nor the group, that becomes the
principal unit of interaction. It is around the individual that
communities providing support, sociability, information, and a sense of
belonging aggregate. This is why they are named 'personalized
communities'.

A third aspect in common with Castells, relates to the dichotomies
territorialized/affinity-based community and
household/individual-centred community. On this, Wellman superimposes
the structural distinction between group and network following his own
early distinction between strong and weak ties.[^06chapter03_19] Networks are
sparsely-knit (i.e., few people are directly connected), far-flung,
loosely-bounded (i.e., few ties stay within the densely-knit cluster),
and fragmentary. In networked societies 'boundaries are permeable,
interactions are with diverse others, connections switch between
multiple networks, and hierarchies can be flatter and recursive'.[^06chapter03_20]
Conversely, groups are densely-knit, tightly-bounded and multithreaded
(i.e., most ties contain many role relationships).

Group and networks are not necessarily opposed: 'formally, a group is a
special type of network'.[^06chapter03_21] However, Wellman prefers to simplify and
fix an opposition: 'in practice, it is linguistically convenient to
contrast groups and networks'.[^06chapter03_22] Wellman also tends to identify the
group/network dichotomy with the territorial/affinity-based community
dichotomy: he basically uses the term 'group' to indicate
neighbourhood-bounded door-to-door connectivity while the place-to-place
and person-to-person models of interaction are structured as 'network'.

On one point Wellman's and Castells' positions differ. According to
Wellman, community can resemble groups or networks or both, while for
Castells it is opposed to networks and corresponds rather to Wellman's
definition of 'group'. Actually, for Wellman 'community' does not refer
to a specific social structure, but it seems to be related to a
particular type of substance that characterizes social ties through a
sense of belonging.[^06chapter03_23] As a consequence, given the current trend
towards networks, Wellman concludes that nowadays we do not find
community in bounded groups anymore, but rather in loose networks:
'arguments and evidence converge in thinking about the transformation of
community from solidarity groups to individualized networks', today
there is a 'predominance of networks (rather than groups) in
communities'[^06chapter03_24]

Castells' and Wellman's arguments are of merit in developing the crucial
intuition that society and technology are intertwined in ways that are
much more complex than simple causality models would imply. In Wellman,
the multi-causality explanation model allows him to take distance from
cyberculture's utopias underpinned by a simple cause-and-effect theory
of action, and to introduce more variegated forms of interaction between
technology and society. Yet in these authors' approaches these two
dimensions are conceived of as distinct domains.

From another perspective, their approach set binary types of aggregation
('territorial community' vs. 'affinity-based community', 'collective'
vs. 'individual', 'group' vs. 'network') that are to be used as starting
points for sociological inquiries. However, it is not clear whether
these categories only partially overlap, or whether one
overlays/excludes the others. In Wellman's argument, for instance,
bounded groups made of strong ties characterize door-to-door
neighbourhood communities ('group' overlays the 'territorial community'
category), while loose networks made of weak ties characterize
communities based on common interests ('network' overlays the
'affinity-based community' category). Furthermore, networks as a
structure characterize also person-to-person networks of individuals as
well as place-to-place household-based communities. That is, 'network'
overlays the 'individual' category and it also overlaps with
'collective' as far as household communities are concerned, but not as
far as neighbourhood communities are concerned. In other words, while
the 'territorial vs. interest community' dichotomy corresponds to the
'group vs. network' one, the 'collective vs. individual' dichotomy seems
to be transversal to the previous ones.

On a different level, it is not evident why territorial, neighbourhood
communities should be completely identified with bounded groups, while
studies have usually shown that street corners and coffee shops are the
'third places' where mainly weak ties proliferate.[^06chapter03_25] Similarly, it is
not obvious why the intersection between 'group' and 'affinity-based
community' is not taken into consideration. After all, it is at least as
much likely that strong ties emerge from cultural affinity and
similarity of interests as that they emerge from mere physical dwelling
proximity.

Such a terminological ambiguity is probably partly due to the two,
divergent meanings that are associated with 'social': 'social' as
related to human beings and thus opposed to 'technology', and 'social'
as 'collection of human beings', thus opposed to 'individual'.[^06chapter03_26] As
to this point and to the notion of 'community' as a peculiar type of
substance, we shall see in the next chapter how a shrunken meaning of
'social' could lead the researcher astray.

On the relationship between technology and society, Wellman's argument
seems to lack logical consequentiality in its conclusions. Wellman
acknowledges that internet facilitates the maintenance of weak ties and
that mobile technologies' affordances enable the individual to be the
hub of different flows of communication. However, this does not
logically imply that 'networks of individuals' are the dominant type of
aggregate making up the social world, nor that they can be seen as the
best type of grouping with which to start a sociological inquiry.
Logically speaking this is an inference that does not follow the
premises. Apart from the fact that it minimizes the constraints related
to the digital divide,[^06chapter03_27] this inference follows a linear evolutionary
model according to which dominant forms of sociability progressively
replace non-dominant ones. Yet, as we shall see in section 4.3,
different models of sociability do not need to be mutually exclusive,
but can co-exist and fulfil different functions.

The point here is understanding whether 'group', 'network of
individuals', 'territorial community', 'personalized community' are
conceived of as ideal types that intertwine in the actual world, or
whether Wellman looks at them as macro-structural trends that sharply
cut society in terms of 'groups' or 'networks', place-to-place or
person-to-person connectivity according to an evolutionist model that
sees bounded groups withering in favour of me-centred loose networks.

## 3.2 Towards Organized Networks

Not all scholars who have addressed the question on whether digital
communities are still relevant actors of the virtual world have turned
to focus on the individual as the hub of contemporary computer-mediated
models of sociability. Different solutions (and questions) come from the
domain of media studies and software development.

Internet commentator Clay Shirky, for instance, has pointed out that the
de-coupling of groups in space and time[^06chapter03_28] allowed by the internet has
ushered in a host of new social patterns which are embodied in social
software. According to Shirky, what makes social software different from
other communication tools is that through social software *groups* are
brought into existence as entities in their own right.

A group of people interacting with one another will exhibit behaviours
that cannot be predicted by examining the individuals in isolation,
peculiarly social effects like flaming and trolling or concerns about
trust and reputation. This means that designing software for
group-as-user is a problem that can't be attacked in the same way as
designing a word processor or a graphics tool.[^06chapter03_29]

Since the software interface rearranges the regimes of access and
visibility, 'social software is political science in executable
form'.[^06chapter03_30] This argument is a key one, as it draws an interpretation of
'the political sphere' which is immanent to digital media: handling the
procedures and protocols whereby people aggregate, social software
always embodies political decisions.

From a similar perspective, Geert Lovink and Ned Rossiter's 'organized
networks' combine the efforts to assemble collective agents with that of
addressing organizational impasses typical of digital communities, such
as accountability, sustainability, and scalability. We have already seen
how Lovink re-examines the notion of virtual communities as social
networks and focuses on how they reflect society as well as anticipate
new forms of social interaction.[^06chapter03_31] Making a step forward, Lovink and
Rossiter argue that online forms of cooperation are still possible, on
condition that communitarian efforts distance themselves from the
libertarian ideology.[^06chapter03_32] [^06chapter03_33]

First, Lovink and Rossiter specify that 'organized networks' are not a
new type of social actor resulting from statistical analysis, but should
be read as a proposal or guidelines aimed at replacing the inflated term
'virtual community'. Albeit on a theoretical level, the authors try to
address many of the impasses we reviewed in the previous pages. The
notion of 'organized networks' recognizes the limits that virtual
communities and tactical media have been unable to deal with, and tries
to figure out new strategic directions for techno-social assemblages
that aim at experimenting forms of social interaction.

To do this, organized networks first need to acknowledge that
instability, conflict, heterogeneity, passivity are the norm, and
collaboration, unity and cooperation are exceptions. Freedom of refusal
and 'notworking' are put at the very heart of any collaboration:

> organised networks are "clouds" of social relationships in which
> disengagement is pushed to the limit. Community is an idealistic
> construct and suggests bonding and harmony, which often is simply not
> there. \[...\] Networks thrive on diversity and conflict (the
> notworking), not on unity, and this is what community theorists are
> unable to reflect upon.[^06chapter03_34]

Despite claims for participation and interactivity, in the digital
society passivity rules: activities like browsing, watching, waiting,
surfing and long periods of 'interpassivity' characterize online life.
Total involvement would mean billions of replies from all to all and the
implosion of any network. Therefore -- the authors argue -- networks are
kept together by a 'shared sense of potentiality' and at the same time
are kept by the fact that this potentiality is realised only in part.

Furthermore, disagreement and distrust do not imply the disruption of
the flow of dialogue. Rather, they act as productive principles, as
'disputes condition \[...\] internal to the creation of new
institutional forms'.[^06chapter03_35] To explain this point the authors introduce
the notion of a 'constitutive outside' as a 'process of post-negativity
in which rupture and antagonism affirm the future life of the
network.[^06chapter03_36] The tension between internal dynamics and external forces
comprises a new ground of "the political"'.[^06chapter03_37] [^06chapter03_38] In other words,
in organised networks the 'outside' always plays a constitutive role in
determining the direction, actions and shape of the network, which is
always situated. The 'other' is visible, present and active.

Similar to the approaches reviewed in the previous section, organized
networks are made of loose ties, forms of collaboration are always
temporary, voluntary and subjected to disengagement: 'networks foster
and reproduce loose relationships. They are hedonistic machines of
promiscuous contacts. Networked multitudes create temporary and
voluntary forms of collaboration that transcend but do not necessary
disrupt the Age of Disengagement'.[^06chapter03_39]

Here is where Lovink and Rossiter meet Wellman. Yet there is a relevant
difference between them. On one hand, while he disregards conflict,
Wellman conceives of networks as structures and considers community as a
sort of psychological substance -- characterized by 'sense of belonging'
-- that nowadays is embodied in networked structures rather than in
bounded groups. On the other hand, Lovink and Rossiter abandon the
structuralist distinction between form and substance and, with it, the
idealist construct of a community kept together by solidarity, harmony
and support: conflict is as constitutive for networks as inner harmony
is. In addition, the two authors specify that organised networks 'are
specific in that they are situated within digital media'.[^06chapter03_40]

By blurring the distinction between 'horizontal' and 'vertical' models
of organization, organized networks aim at constituting themselves as
new hybrid formations where tactical media encounter institutions: 'all
forms of techno-sociality combine both horizontal and vertical forms of
organization. Our argument is not so much that a hard distinction
separates these modes of organization, as a degree in scale.'[^06chapter03_41] As in
Turner's concept of heterarchy, their hybrid nature would allow
organized networks to obtain benefits from both the tactical and the
institutional domains. In particular, in order to develop their own form
of organisation, emergent organised networks must address three crucial
aspects: accountability, sustainability, and scalability.

As to accountability, Lovink and Rossiter do not leave room for much
ambiguity: 'networks disintegrate traditional forms of representation
\[...\] it is time to abandon the illusion that the myths of
representational democracy might somehow be transferred and realised
within network setting. That is not going to happen'.[^06chapter03_42] Nor do
process-oriented forms of governance like those experimented by hackers
seem to be sustainable in the long haul. According to the authors, the
issue of accountability and transparency are crucial and need to be
addressed starting from a set of questions: 'Where does it \[i.e., the
organised network\] go? How long does it last? Why do \[sic\] it in the
first place? But also: who is speaking? And: why bother? A focus on the
vital forces that constitute socio-technical life is thus
required'.[^06chapter03_43]

Another major issue is sustainability. Here is where organised networks
distance themselves the most from their precursors of the 1990s --
lists, collaborative blogs, alternative media[^06chapter03_44] -- that rarely put
business models on the agenda. Lovink and Rossiter on the contrary break
some taboos associated with early independent digital communities. The
first is planning. According to the authors, current independent digital
networks must overcome their self-destructive tendency and accept the
challenge of cautious planning. Defining a collaborative value system
that is able to address issues like funding, internal power management,
accountability, and transparency constitutes the first step.

The second taboo to be faced is legal status. The constitution of an
organization with legal status should not be excluded. Third, as work
has to be paid, it is necessary to face economic reality and to outline
how networks can be funded over time. The economy of the free can work
for free software geeks that develop their own coding projects, but not
necessarily for cultural, artistic, activist projects, content editors,
and web-designers. Fourth, as attracting funding from private
philanthropy, governments and business tends to be a hard task,
complementary currencies need to be devised.[^06chapter03_45] Devising alternative
currencies would also allow organised networks to refuse the
cybercultural logic of free labour and free contents.

Lastly, another issue that organized networks have to face is
scalability. It tackles a well-known aspect of online communities: the
tendency to split up in myriad micro-conversations when they reach a few
thousand participants. According to Lovink and Rossiter, this issue lies
at the convergence between software architecture and internal power
structures. In this regard, the notion of the 'constitutive outside' is
crucial: it is exactly because organised networks need to open up new
horizons within which 'the political' find a space of expression that
the requirement of scalability has to be addressed. If in the digital
organised network the 'outside' has to play a constitutive role in
determining the actions of the network, then software needs to embody
this principle by allowing the 'other' to be always visible and
present.[^06chapter03_46] However, addressing this demand for scalability means to
overtly recognize internal informal power structures and to go beyond
the dominant assumption of decentralization that prevents the discussion
about new forms of organization -- the authors argue.

Once the taboo of decentralisation has been called into question, for
Lovink and Rossiter it is easy getting rid of the last legacies of the
techno-libertarian cyberculture. First, they point out how blogs and
social networks are based on software that refuses antagonisms. Similar
software does not leave any other choice than accepting an inflation of
friends: 'this is New Age revivalism at work, desperately insecure, and
in search of a "friend".[^06chapter03_47]

Second, the authors observe that while wiki software allows the
collaborative creation of 'collective intelligence', this specific
social-technical model will probably not work in all cultures and
countries, as, for instance, those where public work and full visibility
are not appreciated. Despite free culture's claims, sharing knowledge is
not a universal value.

Third, Lovink and Rossiter point out the naivety of those initiatives,
like the Creative Commons, that seek to conquer institutions and
cultural industries to their cause by recalling their 'non-political'
character, while, on the contrary, 'there is no escape from politics'.
According to the authors, the rhetoric of openness hides the political
motivations and economic interests at work in these projects: 'the
provocation of organised networks is to unveil these mechanisms of
control and contradiction, to discuss the power of money flows, and to
redirect funds \[...\] the organised network has to break with the
"information must be free" logic'.[^06chapter03_48]

## 3.3 The Proliferation of 'Community'

At the end of this long *excursus*, the reader might feel puzzled,
wondering whether in the first decade of the 21st century talking of
communitarian ties being developed online makes sense at all. She would
have good reasons to be justified in her puzzlement.

Despite the radical ongoing transformations discussed in chapter 2,
nowadays references to 'community' are more numerous than ever.
According to the *2007* *Digital Future Report* elaborated by USC
Annenberg School Center for the Digital Future, 67.2 percent of members
of online communities[^06chapter03_49] answer their community is very or extremely
important to them, while 46.1 percent of members say they benefit a lot
from their community and only 3.8 percent find no benefit from their
online community.[^06chapter03_50] Under different forms, online communities are
recognized as key social aggregates in diverse fields of activity. While
'cyber-communities' are disappearing from the top of the digital
culture's hot concepts list, articles about 'social networking sites'
colonize high-tech magazines' columns, 'communities of practice'
constitute the backbone of corporate knowledge management policies,
while almost every venture capitalist and internet marketer invokes
participation through 'Web 2.0 community tools' as a strategic component
adding value to internet companies' investments.[^06chapter03_51]

While the cyberculture paradigm underpinning the notion of online
community is showing its limits, other domains are taking over this
concept. As a consequence, its boundaries have become fuzzy. In late
2000s, online communities are becoming more and more difficult to
identify, and the relationship between access to digital media and
empowerment hard to disentangle. It is not clear anymore whether there
exist ties that are specific enough to be called 'communitarian' and
that can be assembled together in constituting a special assemblage.
'Community' seems to be watered down: it is diffused everywhere and yet
nowhere in particular.

To a phenomenological observation, one can see three currents that are
rippling the apparently flat ocean's surface of digital communities.
First, to the new popularity of digital communities an ever-widening
meaning of community corresponds. There is a clear etymological trend in
the successive variations of this expression. It goes from the most
specific and context-related meaning of the 1980s' underground scene to
the most generic one. As a matter of fact, the definition of digital
communities has been ranging up to include almost every form of
aggregation through ICT: RSS feeding, tagging, blogging, bookmarking
associate multimedia objects as well as digital *personae*.

What is thus at stake is not only the possibility to identify
communities, but the meaning of the same notions of collaboration and
the nature (human/machinic) of those actors supposed to collaborate. Can
individuals using the same tags in order to organize and share their own
pictures through a web platform be considered a community or, at least,
a network? Which kind of collaboration is conveyed by a video posted in
order to critically respond to a previously published one? Are the bonds
arising from blog cross-linking similar to those originated through
USENET? Ultimately, these questions lead to ask whether it is possible
to extend agency to technological artefacts.

Second, it might be affirmed that the term 'online community' has been
growing in popularity as the range of potential shared interests has
widened. The Berkshire Encyclopaedia of Human Computer Interaction
indicates that digital divide reduction, open access to ICT, local
communities' empowerment, and revitalized democracy were the issues that
were mostly addressed by 'cybercommunities' during late 1990s and early
2000s. With social networking sites and Web 2.0 the identification of an
explicit interest focus -- beyond sociability itself -- has become
increasingly hard. If early digital communities were glued together
exactly by a common mission, this doesn't seem the case anymore. In her
effort to classify text-based virtual communities, for instance, Mascio
recognizes that 'since it is usually very generic, the interest focus
cannot be considered a prolific category for research'.[^06chapter03_52]

Likewise, echoing Wellman's vocabulary, boyd and Ellison argue that
social network sites mark a shift from interest-centred networks to
me-centred networks and that this shift 'mirrors' a new organizational
structure of online communities:

> the rise of SNSs indicates a shift in the organization of online

Third, we are witnessing the explosion of the *gemeinschaft* well beyond
the domain of sociology and computer science -- towards economics and
management, as well as beyond academic institutions -- towards market
and corporate media. It has crashed the boundaries of social sciences
and urban planning to shore on the crowded coast of business, internet
companies and media discourse. Amin and Thrift argue that while the
concept of 'community' is called into question inside its native urban
studies domain, paradoxically it seems to gain new relevance as a key
element of success for economic systems.[^06chapter03_55] In order to explain why
some cities have turned out to be more competitive than others, for
example, scholars like Storper and Scott have stressed the role of
community-based non-economic ties in economic processes of adaptation
and knowledge sharing.[^06chapter03_56] Similarly, a number of works have argued
that the key to success with online businesses is the development of
virtual communities.[^06chapter03_57]

As a consequence of these movements, it is by no means certain that
nowadays what is meant by the term 'online community' in all these
domains relates to the same thing. As we have seen in chapter 1,
Rheingold's foundational book can be conceived of as a rhetorical
performative endeavour to merge multiple streams in a coherent account
of online sociability. Such an endeavour converged along the lines of
the dominant U.S. cyberlibertarian paradigm, and conceived communal ties
as a sort of 'substance'. This explains why early researchers in the
1990s could quite straightforwardly not only postulate specific
definitions of digital communities, but also classify them on the basis
of their kind of interface (text-based/graphics) or of time modalities
(synchronous/asynchronous).[^06chapter03_58]

However, when it came to explaining how digital communities are upkept
and reproduced, the digital communitarian paradigm fell short of
convincing theories. Scholars and practitioners have thus attempted to
explain sense of belonging not as a substance, but in terms of the
structural form of the network,[^06chapter03_59] as a shift from an aesthetics of
representation to an aesthetics of interaction,[^06chapter03_60] as a form of
consensus building embedded in software platforms,[^06chapter03_61] or even by
negating any predetermined sense of belonging.[^06chapter03_62]

Some of these attempts were justified in the backdrop of recent
developments in the economy of the internet and in the politics of
information (see chapter 2), which have called into question the utopias
that the digital community paradigm inherited from cyberculture. The
shift from the prairie to the battlefield has been acknowledged by
scholars and commentators who have renounced to acknowledge peculiar
social aggregates kept together by communal ties. Influential
sociologists discussed in this chapter, for example, have even replaced
'communities' with 'networks' of individuals.

Other scholars -- like Lovink and Rossiter -- are more optimistic
towards the renaissance of communitarian ties online, provided that the
collaborative perspective gets rid of the libertarian paradigm that
postulates harmony, stability, homogeneity, and proactivity as the norm.
Along this same line lies the main proposal of this book. Instead of
claiming the ontological death of digital communitarian ties, it
suggests that in the face of contemporary developments an
anti-essentialist, materialist perspective has to be mobilized. Such an
epistemological perspective entails the refusal of a priori definitions
of 'community', and rather privileges asking actors themselves to
provide accounts of what 'community' means for them.

Drawing on the developments accounted for in chapter 2, but avoiding
swift conclusions, this book in other words suggests that such
developments can constitute an opportunity to answer an open question by
means of empirical analysis. Under what conditions is it possible to
conceptualize online sociability in the first decade of the 21st
century? Answering this question would liberate the communitarian
perspective from many of the misunderstandings that dragged it into such
a blind alley.

The chapters that follow answer this question by avoiding a macro
account and by investigating the theories of actions that have
underpinned the development of techno-social assemblages for online
collaboration after the fade of the 'golden age' of digital communities.
In so doing, it returns a multi-faceted picture of contemporary
sociability online. The next chapter starts with an analysis of the
notion of 'digital communities' in the words of their spokespersons.

    deployed, as it can be noticed from this quotation: it is not clear
    why community's 'values and social organization' should be seen as
    opposed to network's 'choices and strategies', as if networks were
    not built on common values. After four pages, in fact, Castells
    himself asserts that 'individuals build their networks, on-line and

    Wellman uses the term 'community' is fluctuating and sometimes
    contradictory. While most times it seems to refer to a substance
    that characterizes social ties based on solidarity and not to a
    structure, in some occasions it is used as synonymous of
    neighbourhood-based bounded group. For instance, 'where high speed
    place-to-place communication supports the dispersal and
    fragmentation of *community*, high speed person-to-person
    communication goes one step further and supports the dispersal and
    role-fragmentation of *households*', Wellman, 'Physical place and

[^06chapter03_46]: Contrarily to what happens with blogs -- the authors argue, where
    the 'enemy' is invisible and only friends are present. This is
    possible because the logic of blogs is that of the link. It is links
    that enhance visibility through a ranking system, and links
    correspond to 'friends', to the blog's cultural enclave. All what is
    outside the zone of affinity simply does not exist. With blogs 'the
    political' corresponds to the moment of linking. 'The fact that I do
    NOT link to you remains invisible. \[...\] Blogs can thus be
    understood as incestuous networks of auto-reproduction', Lovink and
    Rossiter, 'Dawn of the Organized Networks', 7. Blogs are not
    organised networks because they are not open, they close themselves
    to the potential for change. See also Lovink, *Zero Comments.*

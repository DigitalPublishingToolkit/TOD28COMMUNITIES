# 5. COMMUNITIES BEYOND 'COMMUNITY'

While the previous chapter has investigated the semantic profiling of
'online community', this chapter aims to analyse how communities are
implicitly enacted through the data sets of submissions to Ars
Electronica's Digital Communities competition. Drawing on an
anti-essentialist, performative approach[^08chapter05_1], it focuses on the way
communities are said to exist by spokespersons to a major international
competition.[^08chapter05_2] Such an approach allows bypassing 1990s' discussions
about what should be considered a 'proper' online community, and
focusing instead on techno-social assemblages that are acknowledged as
occurrences of digital communities by virtue of being presented to and
admitted by one such competition.

To do so, the chapter retains a relational definition of digital
communities, and identifies the relevant topics in the data set. As seen
in chapter 4, the chosen software defines as 'relevant' those concepts
which are not only more frequent, but also more often co-occurring in a
cluster of other frequent words. In Leximancer a word is said to be
'part of' a concept if it often co-occurs with it and occurs not so
often with other concepts (i.e., the relevancy standard deviation value
is above a set threshold). This inclusion is achieved through
'learning', an iterative process in which the collection of terms
defining a concept is updated, so that initially central terms can reach
a peripheral position or even be lost when relevancy is normalised after
a certain number of iterations. The aim of concept learning is to
discover clusters of words which, when taken together as a concept,
maximise the relevancy values of all the other words in the document.

Despite machine learning, the method followed in this research left the
researcher much more room than using software automation would suggest.
On one hand, the specific software techniques used were selected by
attentively setting the software.[^08chapter05_3] Very different results were
obtained by changing only a few settings. For example, the analysis
discussed in the previous chapter established 'online community' as
seeding word, and results were considerably different from those
discussed in this chapter, which were obtained by not setting any
seeding word.

On the other hand, software-extracted concepts constituted only the
starting point of the analysis. It was only by qualitatively comparing
the relative strengths of concepts co-occurring with the most relevant
ones that I came to identify full-blown topics and narratives. Actually,
the effort to move from mined concepts to full-blown topics informs this
whole chapter.

Figure 4 shows the conceptual map extracted from the data set without
any word seeding function.[^08chapter05_4] The map's most remarkable characteristic
is its stability: at every resetting, concepts aggregated in stable
clusters. Differently from the conceptual map in the previous chapter,
in which loose concepts were reshuffled at every resetting, here it was
possible to identify recurrent and stabilized concept clusters.

Figure04

Figure 4 -- Conceptual map without word seeding. Bird's eye

Concepts are clustered in thematic circles that form around the most
connected ones: *information, (web)site, social, art, work, software,
radio, research, technology, system* and *rural*. Here some
technology-related concepts are crucial, that were absent when 'online
community' was seeded as key concept (see previous chapter). For
example, it is significant[^08chapter05_5] that -- when 'online community' was taken
as a key concept -- technological objects were conceived only as
'tools'[^08chapter05_6]. Differently, in the unseeded analysis they are specified as
'technology', 'software', 'website'. In other words, while in discourses
on online communities (i.e., the seeded analysis) the role of technology
is black-boxed as mere tool, outside that discourse there seems to be
more room for artefacts to be unpacked. It is only when the rhetoric
about online communities is dropped, that artefacts can appear in their
role as mediators keeping human relations going.

Conversely, if we consider the concepts related to 'online community' in
the seeded analysis, some of them are not present in the unseeded one.
For example, in the concept list in Table 9 there is no reference to
'individuals' as agents of change, nor to the classical dichotomy
between 'physical' and virtual realms. As we have seen in chapter 1,
individualism and a sharp separation between the brick-and-mortar world
and cyberspace were among the elements that digital communitarians
inherited from early cyberculture. Indeed, these two concepts appear in
the data set only when online community is taken as a seed, and not in
the unseeded semantic profiling. It could thus be suggested that
networked individualism and the physical/virtual separation are part of
the discourse *on* digital communities, but they are not part of current
practices *of* online assemblages.

## 5.1 From Concepts to Full-blown Topics

Figure 4 shows 'relevant' concepts, that is, frequent words that
co-occur more often with some other words, and less often with other
ones. In that map, broader themes form around a highly connected
concept, from which they borrow the label, and aggregate less connected
ones. For instance, the theme *Art* borrows the label from the highly
connected concept 'art' and aggregates the concepts 'media' and 'music',
as well. The relationship between the main concept/theme and the
aggregated concepts is based on contextual similarity: they appear in
similar contexts in the data set. However, to what extent do these
themes develop into full-blown topics? How can narratives be identified
from a list of co-occurring concepts? How can we account for the
theories of actions involving artefacts that underpin techno-social
online collaboration, that is, this book's main empirical question?

In order to address these requests, different methods than map
visualization are needed. Co-occurrence patterns were thus
systematically browsed, and corresponding textual excerpts thoroughly
analysed in order to identify full-blown concepts and narratives. In so
doing, I did not only consider the co-occurrences recurring inside
thematic clusters, but opened up the analysis to the whole co-occurrence
lists of highly relevant concepts. In this way, I tried to give reasons
for those concepts being included in the more fragmented clusters, as
well.

As an example of this method, the theme *Rural* aggregated the concepts
'rural', 'health', and 'learned'. These concepts were strongly related:
'rural' occurred very often with 'learned' and quite often with
'health', while 'health' and 'rural' were the concepts with which
'learned' most frequently co-occurred. The co-occurrence pattern between
'rural' and 'learned' singled out textual excerpts that could be
browsed. Through browsing, a recurring narrative could be identified:
that of information technologies conceived of as benefiting the quality
of life of rural populations by allowing access to informal education.
The rise of social networks was thus deemed the unmediated consequence
of the possibility to access ICT. Conversely, lack of IT-mediated
knowledge caused severe impairments:

> The farmers of the riverside remotest areas \[of Bangladesh\] do not
> have any access to the information society; consequently the
> conditions of 7,000 rivers and streams of the country are degrading
> day by day with negative impact on the overall health of the aquatic
> system, human health, biodiversity, rural economy, rural life etc.
> \[...\] Due to the knowledge gap of the farmers on proper use of
> fertilizer and pesticide the usages went up a hundred times over the
> last thirty years, but with the education of the Mobile Units,
> thousands of farmers were trained on proper use of fertilizer and
> pesticides, agricultural productivity is increased and thousands of
> landless farmers did not have to leave their villages in search of
> work. \[...\] Technology contributes to the democratization of
> information and offers assistance to the underprivileged people of the
> remotest areas. This project has helped the people who had no right to
> be accessed to the information society. The rural people now can
> discuss their points of views and express their opinions. With the
> mobile unit activity their voices are disseminated in the distant
> areas and to other farming groups, and in this way they are able to
> think and decide the alternative ways for their local problems. Now
> they can look at the whole world, establish their relationships with
> it and, in this way they are building up a vision of development. [^08chapter05_7]

This narrative corresponds to one of the topics identified in chapter 4:
'rural development through education'. Although this kind of narratives
was quite recurrent, in our data set it followed a decreasing temporal
trend. While several applications dealt with it in 2004, from that year
onwards it became less and less popular, as figure 5 shows.

Figure05

Figure 5 -- Temporal trend for 'rural'

In summary, the qualitative analysis conducted for all themes (figure 4)
shows that not all of them correspond to full-blown topics. Some of them
(i.e., *Site, Social, Research, System*) turned out to be aggregates of
concepts whose closeness in the map did not reveal any recognizable
narrative. Conversely, some others showed meaningful associations and
deserved further investigation. Notably, *Art, Information, Work,
Software\'* aggregated elements that co-occured with a certain
regularity and suggested the following topics:

-   free and open software

-   local development and information

-   cultural work

-   media art

## 5.2 Social Software as Mediator or Intermediary

As with 'work' (see below), 'software' was a key concept over the four
years of competition being analyzed, with only a light decrease in
frequency in 2006 (figure 6). The theme *Software* aggregated the
concepts 'software', 'video', 'open', 'free', 'collaboration'. Also
'collaboration' -- not a frequent concept in itself -- was part of this
theme. Notably, a very strong co-occurrence pattern between 'software',
'free' and 'open' was recognizable.

Figure06

Figure 6 -- Temporal trend for 'software'

'Software' was strongly related with 'free' (they co-occurred 11% of
times in which 'software' appears) and 'open' (10,8%), while the
strength of co-occurrence with 'social' was considerably lower (3,7%).
Similarly, while 'open', 'free', and 'software' appeared in similar
conceptual contexts in the map, 'social' and 'software' did not (see
figure 7).

Figure07

Figure 7 -- Co-occurrence between 'software' and 'free'/'open'/'social'

This evidence leads to register a predominance in the data set of the
FLOSS and hacker discourse over the Web 2.0 one, one of whose key
expressions is precisely 'social software'. Further evidence is provided
by Leximancer's entity vocabulary list: among the top thirty most
frequent words appearing in sentences containing 'software', 'social'
appeared 222 times, while 'open' 422 times and 'free' 420 times.

Textual excerpts browsing confirmed this insight and added further
elements. On one hand, in all cases where 'software' occurred with
'free' and/or 'open', these terms were used to describe FLOSS
initiatives participating in the competition: from *FSF-GNU* and *Linux*
to *dyne.org* and epigones. On the other hand, less homogeneous
narratives were identified by the co-occurrence of 'software' and
'social'. This lack of homogeneity is thus worth further analysis.

In the data set, three different meanings of 'social software' were
distinguishable. First, software design was seen as constituting a
moment for 'social inquiry'. As software design usually relies on
knowledge of prior software, by definition software development is a
collaborative process, and software is the artefact that crystallizes
such social process.[^08chapter05_8] See for an example the *Spring-alpha* project:

> Thematically, \"spring-alpha\" is an exploration of the relationship
> between software and social systems, focusing, in particular, on how
> issues in their design and implementation mirror one another. This is
> being realised practically, by taking the development of a game
> simulation world and exploring how the different issues involved in
> its design can form a process of social enquiry. \[...\] \[The game\]
> depicts a story in which the occupants of an industrial housing
> project attempt to establish their own autonomous society. The
> narrative acts as a kind of parable paralleling the themes and
> practice of the project. It will serve as a \"conceptual kernel\"
> which will be extended through collaborative public workshops. The
> content of the game is therefore also developed through a form of
> \"Open Source\" method. Many of the issues involved in designing such
> a game mirror those involved in constructing real-world social
> systems. In this way the development process will act as a form of
> critical social enquiry exposing the relationships of software and
> social systems. Objectives: To demonstrate the potential of software
> design as a process of social enquiry. To extend the collaborative,
> social principles of FOSS beyond programming into broader forms of
> participation and creative practice. To foreground the development of
> software as a fundamentally social process.[^08chapter05_9]

A second, different understanding of social software was laid down by
the *\[meme.garden\]* project. In this case, social software was
conceived of as a peculiar kind of software that emphasizes the human
dimension of networking. Here, 'social' was synonymous of 'human', as
opposed to 'cold' computer systems:

> \[meme.garden\] functions as social software which explores an
> individual\'s interests (whether these interests be news topics,
> political phenomena, health, hobbies, etc) among a social group. The
> software emphasizes the human element inherent in networked tools.
> Artwork created with computerized systems often feels cold and
> impersonal to audiences. The \[meme.garden\] software blends social
> software, search tool, and aesthetic system to visualize
> participant\'s interests in prevalent streams of information,
> encouraging browsing and interaction between users in real time,
> through time. Our goal is to make a social software search engine
> tools that embody human themes.[^08chapter05_10]

A similar narrative was present in the *Barnraiser* submission. For this
project, social software focuses more on the 'social conventions' than
on 'software features'. It 'directly' benefits society by allowing
people to interact and share knowledge. While providing hardware is not
sufficient to assure development, having access to *social* software and
knowing how to use it facilitates the development of society:

> We are a growing movement of people that want to contribute directly
> to a better society by pushing forward the boundaries of social
> software development and education. Social software is developed from
> social convention rather than software features. Social software
> facilitates interaction and collaboration and is changing how people
> communicate. Installing computers and supplying Internet connection is
> not enough when building capacity within society. We need software,
> software that allows that society to develop, allows the people within
> that society to share knowledge and contribute towards their
> information society. We facilitate this by creating free social
> software and ensuring that people can have access to it and the
> knowledge to use it.[^08chapter05_11]

A third narrative associated with social software was provided for
example by *World-Information.org*. Here, the Web 2.0 rhetoric was
explicit. Indeed, social software's peculiarity was seen in allowing the
convergence between sender and receiver, passive user, and content
contributor:

> the \[social software\] content management system had to be
> specifically adaptable to support the different workflow models
> simultaneously because not only internal editors but also external
> parties such as institutions or single individuals must be enabled to
> join the editorial team. Also the very heterogeneous skill levels of
> the prospect users had to be kept in mind. Editors all over the world
> had to be given access to the system over the internet. The user
> interface had to give support during the research process as well
> during content entry.[^08chapter05_12]

In summary, by following co-occurrence patterns for 'software', diverse
narratives emerged, which can be compared to the communitarian rhetorics
discussed in chapters 1 and 2. The most frequent narrative recalls
hacker culture's focus on free and/or open software, as described in
chapter 1. This discourse is dominant over less represented
understandings of 'social software'. Social software can either refer to
a type of 'human' substance opposed to machinic reasoning, or to a
collaborative process of social inquiry. Additionally, the social
networking narrative proper to the Web 2.0 rhetoric addressed in section
2.3 is a minor one.

The differences between these narratives allow introducing a key
category of analysis, that will be crucial to the rest of the book. I
suggest that we can read the difference among those narratives by
recovering the distinction between *mediators* and *intermediaries*.
While Human-Computer-Interaction (HCI) has usually focused on the
'immediacy' between input and output as a key concept for the evaluation
of digital artefacts,[^08chapter05_13] sociology of technology has suggested the
notion of 'mediation' to overcome that dichotomy.[^08chapter05_14] The two
traditions entailed very different approaches towards agency. While for
HCI agency pertains to a full-blown subject endowed with intentionality,
sociology of technology questions the cognitive nature of
intentionality, and sees agency emerging in interaction, distributed
throughout an assemblage, a network of hybrid 'actants'[^08chapter05_15]. For this
scholarship, agency is not embodied in a single actor, nor in a single
'social cause', rather, it is dislocated.

On closer inspection, one could notice that this extended definition of
'action' as 'making someone do something' resembles HCI's notion of
'affordance' as an invitation to action that is embedded in the
artefact.[^08chapter05_16] Nonetheless, a crucial difference between the two
approaches should not be overlooked: while for the theories based on
situated action affordances emerge *during* action, for cognitive
ergonomics the subject and the object are constituted *before* the
interaction.

One of the ways to account for this difference is the distinction
between 'mediation' -- a relationship that constitutes actors while
taking place, from 'intermediation' -- a relationship in which a tool
just transports agency from one pre-existing point to another
pre-existing point. While in intermediation the inputs are enough to
define the outputs, mediation exceeds its inputs and cannot be reduced
to a relationship of cause-and-effect.[^08chapter05_17] Putting it slightly
differently, a mediator is an actant that translates, transforms,
modifies the elements it is supposed to carry; a mediator is never a
cause: it does not determine, but makes someone do something, it
triggers further actions and activates new participants. Every time a
mediator appears, it introduces a bifurcation in the course of action.
Therefore, the chain of action becomes longer and the output is never
predictable starting from the input. On the contrary, an intermediary
only transports agency from an input to an output without transforming
it; the output can therefore be easily predicted. With intermediaries,
elements are usually linked through relationships of cause-and-effect
and the chain transporting action is thus short, often made of only a
couple of elements (i.e., the cause and the effect).

As to the social software cases above discussed, in the
*\[meme.garden\]* and *Barnraiser* accounts, computer systems are
supposed to be cold digital machines and social software acts as an
intermediary that dilutes this coldness into the warmth of human
interaction. Yet social software does not introduce elements that could
interfere with the output, which is simply given by the encounter of the
'digital' with the 'social'. It is thus conceived as an intermediary. On
the other hand, in the *Spring-alpha* project the software and the
social system get constituted *through* their interplay. The gaming
software is a mediator because it transforms the subjects involved: the
output (the 'autonomous society') cannot be predicted by the input (the
'conceptual kernel').

This distinction is going to play a major role in examining the theories
of action which underpin online collaboration, and the role of artefacts
as mediators keeping human relations going, once the online communities
rhetoric is definitely dropped.

## 5.3 Different Technologies for Different Territories

As far as the theme *Information* is concerned, it aggregated the
concepts 'information', 'local', 'government', 'services', 'city',
'human', 'development', 'youth', 'including', 'map', 'life', 'members',
'created'. Among these concepts, 'information' co-occurred frequently
with 'local', 'government', 'development'; 'government' co-occurred
frequently with 'services' and 'development'; 'local' showed a strong
co-occurrence with 'information' and 'development'; 'development' and
'members' co-occured frequently with 'local' and 'information'. As
figure 8 shows, the concept 'information' was most relevant in the
applications submitted in 2004, while it progressively decreased in
importance in the following years.

![information0](media/image1.png){width="3.6458333333333335in"
height="2.9166666666666665in"}

Figure 8 -- Temporal trend for 'information'

In counter-tendency with the dominant internet discourse on
de-territorialization (see sections 1.1, 3.1), and confirming more
recent studies on the territorialization of the Net (see section 2.2),
'information' registers the emergence of a territorial topic. In the
co-occurrence list for 'information', among the five concepts most
frequently co-occurring three displayed a semantic reference to a
territorial dimension ('local', 'government', 'rural'), while another
one ('site') connoted both a physical and a virtual (website) portion of
space (figure 9).

Figure09

Figure 9 -- Co-occurrence map for 'information'

The territorial topic was present also in the co-occurrence scheme for
'development', the fifth item in the list. The strongest item
co-occurring with 'development' was 'local', followed by 'information',
'site', 'software', and 'technology'.

In most of these cases, a recurring narrative emerged, according to
which information technologies are seen as empowering means for local,
rural, disadvantaged communities:

> Namma Dhwani (Our VOICES in the Kannada language) is an initiative
> which has created a space for different rural social groups to utilize
> a combination of cable audio & digital technologies to put in place a
> local information and communication network owned and operated by
> members of the local community. \[...\] Namma Dhwani uses a unique
> model developed to suit local needs and circumstances. It not only
> combines cable audio with new digital media, but also combines these
> media tools with a network of local community groups, specifically
> poor women's self-help groups (SHGs), watershed groups made up of
> local farmers, and a local development resource centre. Namma Dhwani
> has enabled poor semi-literate, women, farmers, labourers, school
> drop-outs and other community members to use information &
> communication media & technologies to create: 1) Their own channels of
> information access, storage and dissemination 2) Their own platforms
> for communication and discussion \[...\] The network successfully
> addresses local information needs and has had a visible impact on
> local development and governance.[^08chapter05_18]

Rural space was however not the only model of territoriality dealt with
in the data set. A distinct relationship between territory and ICT
involved urban spaces. Indeed, 'city' showed an absolutely peculiar
semantic context aggregating around the urban territory, and a specific
'metropolitan' use of information technologies. While 'city' did never
occur with any of the other territorial concepts (i.e., 'rural', 'site'
or 'government', except 'local'), it showed a strong co-occurrence with
'mobile' and 'map'.

Figure10

Figure 10 -- Co-occurrence map for 'city'

Analysing the textual instances, they all dealt with geo-referenced
mobile systems allowing the creation of unconventional maps of the urban
space, and the bottom-up regeneration of a sense of place. Similar
projects were usually subsumed under the umbrella term 'locative media'.
Here is an example:

> Citypoems turns mobile phones in Leeds into widely distributed
> creative writing and publishing tools (70% of teenagers and adults in
> the UK own a mobile phone). Everyone in Leeds can read and write a
> Citypoem, experiencing and contributing to an enriched sense of their
> own place from wherever, and whenever, they are in the city. The
> Citypoems biography is made new by every reader, turning the pages in
> the order of their own daily lives as they move through the city, and
> transforming mobile phones into books with an infinite number of blank
> pages waiting to be filled.[^08chapter05_19]

Summing up, different roles for information technologies were associated
to different types of local territory. The qualitative analysis
uncovered a first discourse in which ICT were depicted as empowering
tools (i.e., intermediaries) fostering the development of disadvantaged,
rural areas, in partnership with local governments, by sharing
information accessible through websites. The second narrative conceives
of information technologies as mobile and urban. They are seen as
representational means that allow the creation of subjective maps of the
urban space, of collectively generated psycho-geographies. With these
different narratives, in our data set the mythological local community
we discussed in chapter 1 hits the ground in two rather different forms,
each of which attributes a different role to digital information
technologies.

## 5.4 Knowledge Labour Between Sustainability and Gift Economy

'Work' is the third most frequent concept in the whole data set. It is
also the second most central concept after 'art', meaning that --
besides being frequent -- it also often appears in contexts where other
relevant concepts are present. Furthermore, despite a decrease in 2005,
the concept 'work' remained frequent over the four years of the Digital
Communities competition (Figure 11).

Figure 11 -- Temporal trend for 'work'

The thematic circle *Work* includes the concepts 'work', 'cultural',
'international', 'network', 'text' (Figure 12). 'Work' more often occurs
with 'art', 'media', 'software', 'open', 'online', 'video'. Notably,
there is a strong co-occurrence between 'work' and 'cultural'.
'Cultural' and 'work' are also very close in the map, meaning that they
appear in similar conceptual contexts. All in all, these co-occurrence
paths show a dominant narrative about knowledge labour, testifying the
reproduction of the creative class narrative well after the dotcom burst
(see section 2.1).

Figure12

Figure 12 -- Co-occurrence map for 'work'

However, that narrative survives in more articulated ways. When it comes
to the models of remuneration of cognitive labour, two different
meanings of 'work' emerge. The first deals with work as an economic
activity, while the second one conceives of work as a voluntary act
oriented to the production of common goods.

On one hand, 'work' appears quite frequently in the section dedicated to
the planned use of the possible prize money (indicated by the recurring
word 'money'). This testifies the intention to allocate some resources
towards the sustainability of cognitive work and to go beyond the
equation 'immaterial work' = 'amateur, unpaid labour' fostered by the
Web 2.0 hype (see section 2.3). A proposal that addresses sustainability
without abdicating to free knowledge is, for example, advanced by the
*SerendiPd* project:

> There are many people who dedicate substantial time and resources to
> making Pd better. We would like to enable such people to earn a living
> while working on Pd, while keeping it free. There are a number of
> methods of raising money for free software projects, including:
> project donations, selling support like RedHat does, and bounty
> systems like those used by GNOME. \[...\] the GNOME bounty system
> (http://www.gnome.org/bounties/) makes the most sense for the Pd
> community. One project that we would like to take on with the prize
> money would be to build a bounty board for Pd, where both user- and
> developed-initiated tasks could be posted. For user-initiated tasks,
> money collection via donations would continue until someone proved
> that the task had been completed; this individual would then receive
> the total collected sum for the work completed. For
> developer-initiated tasks, developers would include their minimum fee
> for execution. Pd users would give money to whichever tasks they
> deemed worthy; when a bounty is reached the developer would then work
> to complete the task, receiving payment upon completion.[^08chapter05_20]

On the other hand, 'work' co-occurs very frequently with 'open' (see
Figure 13). When browsing through the textual instances, it appears
clear that 'open' is used in all the contexts wherein it co-occurs with
'work' as synonymous with 'free'. All these instances deal with the
exaltation of volunteer cognitive work whose efforts allow the creation
and distribution of immaterial commons. Volunteer workers are conceived
of as community-engaged individuals contributing to the free/open
knowledge:

> Ubuntu is a community developed, commercially supported Linux
> distribution with an emphasis on software freedom and making computers
> as easy and accessible for everyone. \[...\] Ubuntu has access to
> thousands of additional tools and applications, and a huge community
> who provide support and assistance to Ubuntu users. Ubuntu is
> commercially supported by Canonical Ltd, but a worldwide network of
> enthusiastic volunteers work together on all aspects of the system,
> providing a solid community orientated distribution.[^08chapter05_21]

Figure13

Figure 13 -- Co-occurrence list for 'work'

All in all, in the data set the topic of labour is still wavering
between the need for economic models that can assure an adequate
remuneration to cognitive work and the push towards the creation and
distribution of open and free commons. However, even when acknowledging
these contrasting narratives about 'work', a significant trend must be
noticed. The entries where 'work' and 'open' co-occur were submitted
mainly in 2004 (76% of cases), while the entries where 'work' and
'money' co-occur were submitted largely between 2006 and 2007 (60% of
cases). This is sufficient evidence of a change in the runderstanding of
work, from volunteer to paid activity, and a detachment from the
rhetoric of user-based unpaid work that we have discussed in chapter 2.

## 5.5 'Public Media Art' as Politics

The last relevant topic emerging from the data set could be defined as
'public media art'. The theme *Art* aggregated the concepts 'art',
'media', 'music', that is, they co-occured in similar contexts. 'Media'
and 'art' co-occured often together, especially in the expression 'media
art'. 'Art' and 'music' showed a lower co-occurrence index. 'Media' and
'music' never occured together. Looking at the temporal trend for the
concept 'art', we can see that in 2005 and 2006 the applications dealt
less with 'art' than in 2004 and 2007, relatively to the total amount of
submissions from each year (Figure 14).[^08chapter05_22]

Figure14

Figure 14 -- Temporal trend for 'art'

A similar trend was shown by the concept 'media': after a strong
frequency in 2004, it decreased until 2007, when it re-gained importance
(Figure 15).

Figure15

Figure 15 -- Temporal trend for 'media'

Among the ten concepts most-frequently occurring with 'art', three were
related to the type of medium ('media' in general, 'online', 'digital'),
three were attributes of art itself ('international', 'open', 'public'),
other three were part of frequent expressions ('cultural', art-'work',
art-'world') (Figure 16). The last one, 'space', was alternatively
included into expressions like 'public space', 'open space', and 'space
of art'.

Figure16

Figure 16 -- Co-occurrence map and concept list for 'art'

Browsing through textual excerpts in more depth, three coherent
narratives emerged when 'art' co-occured with 'public' and 'open'. The
first conceived of art as public because it uses public space as a
creative medium, as the space of exhibition. This was the case of
projects like *Glowlab* -- whose work on psycho-geography dealt
specifically with urban spaces, and *52weeks52works* -- whose artworks
were deployed in public spaces worldwide.

The second narrative stressed the relationship between art and political
engagement in social movements. In the *REPUBLICart* project, for
instance, 'public art' was seen as retaining an organizational,
theoretical and political role:

> the art of res publica is about experimental forms of organizing,
> which develop in precarious micro-situations for a limited period of
> time, testing new modes of selforganization and interplays with other
> experiments. The \"organizing function\" of art (Walter Benjamin)
> creates new spaces in the overlapping zones of art practices,
> political activism and theory production. \[...\] Joining the
> heterogeneous activities against economic globalization, the old forms
> of intervention art are being transformed and new ones are emerging.
> In the context of current political movements, art is becoming public
> again.[^08chapter05_23]

The third narrative related to open/public art focused on a
process-oriented aesthetic. Here, 'open art' is about collaborative
creation eluding copyright regimes:

> The whole basis for the experience is 'intellectual generosity', the
> creation and supporting of an open environment for people to work on a
> project without being tied to any kind of restrictions of production
> created by the copyright. \[...\] Our goal is develop open art,
> produced in a collaborative way, within workgroups spread all over the
> world. [^08chapter05_24]

Open art requires distributed learning and authorship. It is the
response to the privatization of the Web and to the closure of the
source code adopted by digital artists which followed the
commodification of net-art:

> a number of prominent artists have been experimenting with models for
> selling digital art, and dealers who smell money are scrambling to
> help artists package work into closed, exclusive forms. While there\'s
> nothing wrong in principle with making money off art, in practice this
> pressure has led some artists to move toward formats where code is
> hidden from view and where access is controlled by private collectors
> or gated communities.[^08chapter05_25]

According to this narrative, while the blackboxing of code was to lead
to the 'elitarization' of digital media and the exclusion of the many
from such practices, the establishment of ethical procedures and the
promotion of open standards initiated by the community of online artists
was to empower individual artists:

> the opportunity to create open yet enduring standards\--and most
> important, a community ethic\--offers creative individuals a chance to
> take control of their destiny and help shape the culture that
> nourishes them. The Open Art Network aims to empower artists working
> in digital formats by devising and promoting standards that encourage
> an open architecture for the Internet and digital media.[^08chapter05_26]

In such accounts, empowerment proceeds from the opportunity for single
artists not only to consume each other\'s works, but especially to
mutually learn from each other\'s creative process. This possibility is
designed in specific type of artefacts: access to mutual learning is
assured by open standards and procedures. If we assume a definition of
'the political' as both the procedures that allow the assembly to gather
as well as the matter of concern that has to be discussed in the
assembly, in this third meaning 'open art' is eminently political, since
it aims at setting the standards whereby an assembly may
constitute.[^08chapter05_27]

In summary, in the Digital Communities data set, art retains major
relevance, albeit declining. Evidence confirms that the aesthetic
interest that constituted one of the major thrusts for digital
communitarianisms in the 1990s (see section 1.3) maintained its
relevance for online sociability until 2007. Art has also kept an
explicit political function as an opportunity for the empowerment of
individuals through mutual learning. As such, it continues the tradition
of individualistic empowerment á la Rheingold, while combining the
decentralizing, self-organized efforts which characterized the 1990s'
net art and mediactivism cultures.

At this point of the book, we have successfully attempted the tricky
task of identifying relevant topics and narratives in the data set
without postulating actors and theories of action. This shows the
validity of our initial intuition about not rushing to conclusions about
the disappearance of online communities but to conduct empirical
investigation about the conditions under which they can nowadays be
re-conceptualized. Notably, when the early rhetoric about 'online
communities' is dropped -- i.e., when the concept is not 'sown' for
analysis, narratives enlighten theories of action that account for
peculiar roles of artefacts as mediators of human relations. In the next
chapter we shall focus on some of these theories in more depth.

[^08chapter05_5]: My aim is not to give an *explanation* of these results, but to
    *describe* the variations in the elements that constitute one or
    more aggregates. Indeed, this book's approach is not about providing
    a further theory about why social actors act in a certain way, but
    about tracing the minute shifts in meaning left behind by activities
    of group formation. As a consequence, the definition of
    'significant' as 'having a particular meaning' (Oxford Dictionary)
    is the most precise: meaning is given exactly by the shifts in the
    elements that move from one association into another one.

[^08chapter05_6]: Actually, in the previous analysis in chapter 4 'tool' was the
    only concept referring to technological artefacts.

[^08chapter05_8]: This is the crucial insight of net.art, software art and hacker
    practices (see section 1.3). I wish to thank Tatiana Bazzichelli for
    the stimulating discussions about this issue. ANT provides a further
    access to this approach by going back to the semantic root of the
    word 'thing' as 'assembly': 'long before designating an object
    thrown out of the political sphere and standing there objectively
    and independently, the *Ding* or Thing has for many centuries meant
    the issue that brings people together *because* it divides them.
    \[...\] The *Ding* designates both those who assemble because they
    are concerned as well as what causes their concerns and divisions.'
    Latour, 'From Realpolitik to Dingpolitik', p. 13, *italics in the
    text*). According to ANT, 'social' means 'collective' and things
    (also digital artefacts) are 'social' because they are 'assemblies',
    'gatherings'.

[^08chapter05_15]: Latour, *Reassembling the Social*. Latour uses the term 'actant'
    instead of 'actor' in order to gain higher pliability with respect
    to figuration. It might be said that an actant is an abstract agent
    endowed with a narrative function that on a discursive level gets
    embodied into an actor endowed with a figuration. Latour borrowed
    this distinction from semiotics, where it corresponds to the
    deployment of agency respectively on the narrative level (where we
    talk of 'actants') and on the discursive level (where 'actors' lie).
    Greimas and Courtés define an actant as 'the one that performs or
    undergoes the act, regardless of any other determination. Thus,
    quoting L. Tesnière whose work this term is borrowed from, "actants
    are the beings or the things that -- under whichever qualification
    and in whatsoever manner, even as simple bit players and in the most
    passive manner -- take part in the process". Under this perspective,
    the actant designates a type of syntactic unit, a peculiarly formal
    one, before any semantic and/or ideological investment'. See Greimas
    and Courtés, *Sémiotique,*, p. 40, *Author's translation into
    English*. It is interesting to notice that, under this distinction,
    'loose networks', 'communities of practice' and 'groupware' differ
    on a discursive, figurative level, while they might fulfil the same
    logical function in a course of action.

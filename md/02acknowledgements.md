# ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As the ANT teaches, showing gratefulness to all those who contributed to
the course of action that led to this work could turn into a short
summary of the pages that follow.

I thank Elisa Ribaudo, Carmela Torelli, Valerio Minetti, and Davide
Diamantini at the 'Quality of Life in the Information Society' *QUA\_SI
Ph.D* *Program*, University of Milan-Bicocca. Guido Martinotti, my
promoter, prodded my stamina in a risky but clever way. Tommaso
Venturini was a study partner not only in Milan, but since our
undergraduate studies at the University of Bologna. His lucid (and
ludic) suggestions on handling large qualitative data sets were a moment
of nimbleness amidst many doubts.

At the Emilia-Romagna government -- where I used to work during the last
edits of this endeavour -- I am grateful to Silvia Pagnotta, Francesca
Paron e Giancarlo 'Ambrogio' Vitali for understanding the needs and
anxieties of a doctoral student. Thanks also to Giovanni Grazia for his
suggestions on pc emulators for Mac OS.

I wish to thank Neil Hartley and the *Leximancer* staff at the
University of Queensland for providing me with a full trial release of
their software for research purposes. In 2006 Anne Balsamo (University
of Southern California) and David Theo Goldberg (University of
California at Irvine) accepted and facilitated my participation in the
*Seminar in Experimental Critical Theory: 'technoSpheres: FutureS of
Thinking'* at the Human Research Institute, University of California at
Irvine. This was an amazing possibility to enlarge the scope of my
research, and I hope these pages bring forward traces of that
experience. Thanks also to the Annenberg School Center for the Digital
Future, University of Southern California, for having provided me with a
copy of their 2007 'Digital Future Report'.

I am grateful to Tatiana Bazzichelli and Antonio Caronia for their
interest in this research, which brought about my involvement in the AHA
mailing list. Within this network I had an early opportunity to publicly
discuss the theoretical foundations of this work. I would also like to
thank the global Transmission.cc network for having welcomed me -- a
non-techie -- at their spring 2006 workshop, and for the food (for
thought and for the belly) I was fed with at that event. Thanks to
Agnese Trocchi, Andrew Lowenthal, and Andy Nicholson. A huge credit goes
to the *Telestreet* network, and *Orfeo TV* in particular, where I
developed my early reflections and doubts, which have found (partial)
answers in this work.

I am particularly indebted to Ars Electronica and the Boltzmann
Institute Media.Art.Research. in Linz for the interest they have shown
towards this research since its inception. Notably, I wish to thank
Gabriela Blome, Dieter Daniels, Katja Kwastek, Bianca Petscher, and
Gerfried Stocker. The warmest gratitude goes to Andreas Hirsch and
Ingrid Fischer-Schreiber, designers and coordinators of the Digital
Communities competition, for their unique capability to conjugate
professionality and friendship.

Those who will be patient enough to reach the end of this work will
learn that the degree of heterogeneity of actors is an evaluation
criterion for textual accounts. These acknowledgements should thus be a
good text. There are long networks that have few opportunities to
strengthen, and yet they are present, especially when made of women. In
this work there is something by Roberta Buiani, Monica Fagioli, Ilenia
Rosteghin, and Sara Zambotti. I would also like to thank Daniela
Panosetti for her willingness to engage in scientific discussions, even
in a field that is not her own cup of tea, and Francesco Mazzuchelli,
for the precious support with 'computer science diplomacy'.

Finally, my gratefulness goes to the shorter networks. To Cesarina,
Gino, Giuseppe, and Mercedes, for waiting for me. To Michela, who was
there at the right moment and in the right way. To Giorgia, for her
power in facing challenges that have the sole merit of having relegated
mine to placid cabotage. To Ciro, with whom I have crossed these
prairies for the second time. To Antonio e Anna, for having escorted me
until this point with their great energy and entrepreneurship. To that
assemblage of actual and potential elements that could be labeled 'I',
for having kneaded the contributions of many with the yeast of
curiosity.

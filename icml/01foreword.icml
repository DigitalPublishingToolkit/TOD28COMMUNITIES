    <Content>This book was written between 2006 and 2009 as part of my Ph.D. promotion. As often with similar cases, at that time the reasons for not publishing it outnumbered the motives to follow up. First, by the time this book was finalized, the 2008 financial crisis was ravaging Europe, and odds of engaging in a research job in social sciences and humanities were infinitesimal. Some of the research centers with which I collaborated in conducting this research were discontinued in the same weeks in which I was laying down the conclusions. In such a scenario, this book was more likely to mark the end point of my research career -- as that of many others, rather than its beginning. Even when publishers started to approach me, I preferred not to indulge in what at that moment appeared as pointless vanity.</Content>

    <Content>Second, at that time I was probably not fully aware of the importance of keeping a memory of the present. Being myself involved in some digital communitarian initiatives, conducting research was a way to reflect upon our collective grassroots practices in a moment in which they were mimicked by commercial services run by multinational corporations. The attempt to figure out in what ways our practices and infrastructures were different from the emerging services prevailed over the thrust to historicize.</Content>

    <Content>Second, the Cambridge Analytica scandal is only starting to reveal the subtle mechanisms of manipulation allowed by social media platforms. For those who participated in the early 2000s critical internet studies wave, these revelations can hardly come as a surprise. Very early social media abdicated to their communitarian, peer origins, and reproduced the intermediated broadcasting model. It is thus worthwhile to recall -- as this book does in its first part -- the genesis of the Web 2.0 ideology in a period in which internet cultures were confused by the Dotcom burst and new business models were lagging behind.</Content>

    <Content>. My students at a technical university in Northern Europe, for example, know about the mailing list culture of the 1990s. They also know about art and communitarian experiments in the same period. However, they know less about how utopian roots turned into ideologies that eventually brought on the commercialization of the internet, its geographical closure, and its securization. While the goal of this book is not nostalgic, it suggests that things could have been otherwise.</Content>

    <Content>In 2018, a book written between 2006 and 2009 can be read under the lens of a double archaeology. On one hand, the 2009 edition encompassed hegemonic and minoritiarian early digital experiences. From the here-and-now of 2009, it looked back to the genesis of network cultures in the 1980s and 1990s. In the second part, it compared those early discourses and practices to current communitarian developments. On the other hand, this 2018 edition adds a second level of historicization. From the 2018-now, it looks back ten years, before Snowden, when Lawrence Lessig was committed to foster the Creative Commons, and when a book such as Goldsmith and Wu's </Content>

    <Content> returns a multi-faceted picture of internet sociability between the two centuries. Almost one thousand digital communities are analysed here through their own words and rationales, as well as by focusing on the degrees of access and participation that their software architectures allowed. What emerges is a composite landscape made of non-profit and commercial, grassroots and institutional, deterministic, and open efforts to articulate the tension between technology and society. Above all, this rather encompassing study of digital sociability shows that in the 2000s stabilization and innovation dynamics materialized in similar ways in textual and software artefacts. Today, one could say that this study anticipated the 'material turn' in Technology Studies, without renouncing to textual components.</Content>
